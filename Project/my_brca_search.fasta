TI  - Prediction of BRCA gene mutation status in epithelial ovarian cancer by radiomics
      models based on 2D and 3D CT images.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to explore the value of
      two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) radiomics models based on
      enhanced computed tomography (CT) images in predicting BRCA gene mutations in
      patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: The clinical and imaging data
      of 106 patients with ovarian cancer confirmed by surgery and pathology were
      retrospectively analyzed and genetic testing was performed. Radiomics features
      extracted from the 2D and 3D regions of interest of the patients' primary tumor
      lesions were selected in the training set using the maximum correlation and
      minimum redundancy method. Then, the best features were selected through Lasso
      tenfold cross-validation. Feature subsets were employed to establish a radiomics 
      model. The model's performance was evaluated via area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve analysis and its clinical validity was assessed by
      using the model's decision curve. RESULTS: On the validation set, the area under 
      the curve values of the 2D, 3D, and 2D + 3D combined models were 0.78
      (0.61-0.96), 0.75 (0.55-0.92), and 0.82 (0.61-0.96), respectively. However, the
      DeLong test P values between the three pairs of models were all > 0.05. The
      decision curve analysis showed that the radiomics model had a high net benefit
      across all high-risk threshold probabilities. CONCLUSIONS: The three radiomics
      models can predict the BRCA gene mutation in ovarian cancer, and there were no
      statistically significant differences between the prediction performance of the
      three models.

TI  - Preimplantation genetic testing for BRCA gene mutation carriers: a cost
      effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 153
LID - 10.1186/s12958-021-00827-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gynecologic oncologists should be aware of the option of conception
      through IVF/PGT-M for families with high BRCA related morbidity or mortality. Our
      objective was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of preimplantation genetic
      testing for selection and transfer of BRCA negative embryo in BRCA mutation
      carriers compared to natural conception. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of two
      strategies, conception through IVF/PGT-M and BRCA negative embryo transfer versus
      natural conception with a 50% chance of BRCA positive newborn for BRCA mutation
      carriers was compared using a Markovian process decision analysis model. Costs of
      the two strategies were compared using quality adjusted life years (QALYs'). All 
      costs were discounted at 3%. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared
      to willingness to pay threshold was used for cost-effectiveness analysis.
      RESULTS: IVF/ PGT-M is cost-effective with an ICER of 150,219 new Israeli
      Shekels, per QALY gained (equivalent to 44,480 USD), at a 3% discount rate.
      CONCLUSIONS: IVF/ PGT-M and BRCA negative embryo transfer compared to natural
      conception among BRCA positive parents is cost effective and may be offered for
      selected couples with high BRCA mutation related morbidity or mortality. Our
      results could impact decisions regarding conception among BRCA positive couples
      and health care providers.

TI  - Management of breast cancer patients with BRCA gene mutations in Lebanon of the
      Middle East: perspectives and challenges.
PG  - 325-329
LID - 10.1080/21548331.2021.1974678 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This commentary explores and discusses the challenges oncologists
      face in diagnosing and managing breast cancer patients with BRCA gene mutations
      in Lebanon and the Middle East. METHODS: Key opinion leaders shared their
      recommendations to achieve better patient outcomes and satisfaction based on
      evidence-based medicine and their clinical experience in BRCA management.
      RESULTS: Challenges associated with BRCA management can be divided into four main
      levels: physicians, patients, test, and treatment factors. More genetic
      counselors are to be identified given their important role in the management of
      individuals with BRCA gene mutations. CONCLUSION: Genetic counseling, continuing 
      education, infrastructure, testing, expertise, and financial support are needed
      to fulfill the unmet needs in the management of BRCA mutation carriers.

TI  - Poltheta inhibitors elicit BRCA-gene synthetic lethality and target PARP
      inhibitor resistance.
PG  - 3636
LID - 10.1038/s41467-021-23463-8 [doi]
AB  - To identify approaches to target DNA repair vulnerabilities in cancer, we
      discovered nanomolar potent, selective, low molecular weight (MW), allosteric
      inhibitors of the polymerase function of DNA polymerase Poltheta, including
      ART558. ART558 inhibits the major Poltheta-mediated DNA repair process,
      Theta-Mediated End Joining, without targeting Non-Homologous End Joining. In
      addition, ART558 elicits DNA damage and synthetic lethality in BRCA1- or
      BRCA2-mutant tumour cells and enhances the effects of a PARP inhibitor. Genetic
      perturbation screening revealed that defects in the 53BP1/Shieldin complex, which
      cause PARP inhibitor resistance, result in in vitro and in vivo sensitivity to
      small molecule Poltheta polymerase inhibitors. Mechanistically, ART558 increases 
      biomarkers of single-stranded DNA and synthetic lethality in 53BP1-defective
      cells whilst the inhibition of DNA nucleases that promote end-resection reversed 
      these effects, implicating these in the synthetic lethal mechanism-of-action.
      Taken together, these observations describe a drug class that elicits BRCA-gene
      synthetic lethality and PARP inhibitor synergy, as well as targeting a
      biomarker-defined mechanism of PARPi-resistance.

AB  - Reconstructive breast surgery after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in patients
      who carry a mutation of the breast cancer (BRCA) gene has been increasing.
      Undergoing risk-reducing breast surgery can be of great benefit to young patients
      who have a high risk of developing breast cancer. There is little available
      evidence about the rate of complications in these patients and which factors are 
      related to increased complications. The objective of this study was to identify
      predictors of complications in BRCA gene mutation carriers who underwent
      reconstructive breast surgery. A single-center, retrospective cohort study was
      conducted that included all patients with a mutation of the BRCA gene who
      underwent a breast reconstructive procedure, either immediate or delayed, between
      January 2013 and March 2019 and received a minimum of 6 months' follow-up. The
      results of our study showed that smoking is the most important modifiable risk
      factor associated with an increased complication rate for reconstructive breast
      surgery in patients with BRCA gene mutation. Smoking cessation will reduce the
      patient's risk for postoperative complications by 50%; therefore, it should be
      encouraged in all surgical patients and enforced in patients undergoing
      prophylactic procedures.

TI  - BRCA gene testing in women with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.
PG  - 962-965
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2020.1820466 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the pick-up rate of pathogenic BRCA
      variants in those with a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) undergoing
      oncology-led testing with the traditional genetics family history-based testing
      model. With novel therapies, BRCA status can affect treatment. Welsh oncologists 
      are now testing all women with HGSOC at diagnosis rather than referring to
      genetics, where family history is required for testing. The records of 332 women 
      who underwent testing via oncology were analysed. The outcome measures were;
      percentage of women with a pathogenic BRCA variant and the difference in
      identification of pathogenic BRCA variants between the oncology-led and
      traditional genetics testing models. Of the 332 women, 25 women (7.5%) tested
      positive for a pathogenic BRCA variant. This was slightly lower than the
      detection rate of 9.8% for patients tested via the genetics service over the same
      period. Testing through genetics, using family history criteria would have
      identified only 19 (76%) of those with pathogenic variants in the oncology
      cohort. Since women with a pathogenic BRCA variant can be offered life-extending 
      targeted treatment and a significant proportion of these women would be missed if
      testing was offered based on family history criteria alone, universal BRCA
      testing of all women with HGSOC is justified.Impact statement:What is already
      known on this subject? It is well established that individuals with a strong
      family history of breast and ovarian cancer are more likely to carry a pathogenic
      BRCA gene variant. With the use of tools such as the Manchester scoring system
      women are often invited for testing through clinical genetics services. Until
      recently there was no clinical impact for those already diagnosed with ovarian
      cancer.What do the results of this study add? Our study has shown that the
      diagnosis of high grade serious ovarian carcinoma alone without the need for any 
      family history leads to a similar rate of detection of pathogenic BRCA variants
      as traditional methods. With the advent of targeted treatments such as olaparib, 
      women with a pathogenic BRCA variant can access different life extending
      treatment options. With comparable pick-up rates to traditional family history
      based scoring systems, oncologists can now arrange BRCA gene testing
      directly.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or
      further research? Our study shows universal genetic testing of those with
      high-grade serious ovarian carcinoma by oncologists allows more women to access
      life extending treatment in a shorter timeframe compared to the traditional
      testing model used by clinical genetics services. We hope that other centres,
      both in the UK and beyond, will adopt this approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
      patients with BRCA gene mutation have enhanced sensitivity to platinum-based
      regimens and PARP inhibitors. However, the knowledge regarding BRCA mutation in
      Thai patients is limited. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence and
      characteristics of somatic and germline BRCA 1 and 2 mutations in Thai patients
      with these cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The paraffin blocks of tumors with
      histology of high grade serous, high grade endometrioid, or clear cell carcinoma 
      obtained between June 2016 and December 2017 were analyzedto evaluate BRCA
      mutation using next-generation sequencing system. Blood or normal tissue paraffin
      blocks of positive patients were further tested for germline BRCA mutation.
      RESULTS: Tissue paraffin blocks of 178 patients were collected but only 139 were 
      analyzed. Positive BRCA mutation was identified in 24 patients (17.3%): BRCA1 in 
      13 cases, BRCA2 in 10 cases, and BRCA1 and 2 in the rest one. Germline mutation
      study in blood or normal tissue in 23 positive patients revealed BRCA mutation in
      14 cases, BRCA1 in 8 cases and BRCA 2 in 6 cases. Overall, the prevalence of
      somatic and germline mutation was 6.5% (9 out of 138 patients) and 8.7% (14 out
      of 138 patients), respectively. The most common histology associated with BRCA
      mutation was high grade serous cancer (27.3%). No significant difference was
      found between patients with or without BRCA mutation in terms of stage, outcome, 
      platinum status, and survival outcome. CONCLUSION: BRCA mutation was demonstrated
      in less than 10% of Thai ovarian cancer patients. Higher rate of mutation was
      found in high grade serous cancer.<br />.

AB  - The discovery of cancer-causing BRCA1/2 mutations and the emergence of genetic
      testing have brought precision in patient selection for poly-(ADP)-ribose
      polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) treatment. Interestingly, patients who are carriers 
      of BRCA1/2 mutations have a higher risk for developing cancer, but respond better
      to DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy, such as platinum-based chemotherapy. The
      distinctive biology of ovarian cancer involves high genomic instability
      consisting of gene amplification, gene deletion, oncogene hypomethylation, loss
      of heterozygosity, and tumor suppressor gene promoter hypermethylation in many of
      the DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including BRCA1/2. Several of these genetic 
      abnormalities can impair high fidelity DNA damage repair increasing the
      therapeutic audience for PARPi's. This is especially important given the clinical
      development over the last decade of this group of agents and the dramatic
      increase in progression free survival among ovarian cancer patients who received 
      PARPi, both in treatment or maintenance setting. In this review, we summarize our
      current understanding of the role of BRCA1/2 mutations in ovarian cancer and
      present relevant clinical trials in which BRCA1/2 was investigated as biomarker
      for therapy. We also outline the role of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency
      as biomarker by presenting the recent clinical development and recent approvals
      PARPi for firstline maintenance in ovarian cancer.

TI  - BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene mutations as an emerging biomarker for the treatment of
      gastrointestinal malignancies.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.21037/cco-2019-ddp-05 [doi]
AB  - BReast CAncer (BRCA) genes 1 and 2 were discovered in the 1990's by Hall et al.
      and Wooster et al. respectively. BRCA genes have been shown to be associated with
      an increased risk of various gastrointestinal (GI) cancers beyond known risk of
      breast, ovary and prostate cancers. Studies have demonstrated the role of BRCA
      genes in the DNA repair pathway and modalities to exploit this pathway are being 
      currently explored. Using the concept of synthetic lethality, poly-ADP ribose
      polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have significant activity in BRCA deficient cells. 
      Targeted therapy is gaining popularity worldwide and BRCA genes have received
      much attention since the development and approval of PARPis. Multiple studies
      have also identified the predictive value of BRCA genes related to platinum and
      other DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents. BRCA deficient cells are about 5-fold more
      sensitive to platinum-based agents and almost 1,000-fold more with PARPis.
      Genomic instability has been established as the hallmark of BRCA deficient tumors
      and the specific roles of BRCA genes in DNA damage repair is increasingly clear. 
      Herein, we discuss the risks and incidence of individual GI cancers seen with
      BRCA mutations, highlight tumor biology and provide a comprehensive review of the
      available preclinical and clinical data and upcoming trials related to this
      topic. The "POLO" trial in metastatic pancreas cancer establishes a "proof of
      principle" regarding treatment of BRCA-related cancer and PARPi. In pancreatic
      cancer routine germline genetic testing is now recommended in most major
      guidelines. Newer studies are emerging, which will expand the concept of BRCAness
      and ways to effectively detect this phenotype in GI cancers and impact clinical
      practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The University of Alabama at Birmingham Preventative Care Program for
      Women's Cancer provides genetic testing, risk evaluation, and screening for
      breast cancer. Women diagnosed with high-risk mutations may opt to undergo active
      surveillance or prophylactic surgery. This decision requires understanding of the
      surveillance process and its potential outcomes. In this study, we report
      specifically on women with non-BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. METHODS: A
      retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted of women enrolled in our
      program identified as high risk because of non-BRCA mutations. Events regarding
      genetic mutations, method of detection of suspicious lesions, number of biopsies,
      results of those biopsies, prophylactic surgery, and cancer diagnosis were
      collected. RESULTS: We identified 78 patients with asymptomatic non-BRCA
      deleterious mutations. Sixteen mutations were identified, with the most common
      being ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2. In total, 11.5% underwent prophylactic surgery and
      88.5% underwent active surveillance. In the surveillance group, 63.8% had no
      examination or imaging to warrant biopsy, 24.6% had biopsy with benign result,
      and 11.6% had biopsy with malignant result. For the nine women who developed
      breast cancer during surveillance, six were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in
      situ, two with stage I, and one with stage IIA cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Women with
      non-BRCA mutations enroll in prevention clinics with hopes of early detection of 
      breast cancer. Because of increased screening, this population undergoes biopsy
      more frequently; however, during surveillance most do not require a biopsy. For
      those that do, the result is typically benign. This information can further allow
      women to make informed decisions about surveillance and establish realistic
      expectations regarding the likelihood of tissue sampling.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Risk-reducing-salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) inevitably leads BRCA
      mutation carriers to premature menopause. AREAS COVERED: To evaluate the existing
      evidence for use of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) in BRCAmc, after RRSO or 
      menopause occurring naturally, for both breast cancer (BC) survivors and those
      without BC. EXPERT OPINION: All BC survivors are excluded from any HT treatment: 
      in other BRCAmc, before 51 years of age the benefits of HT overcome the risks
      after RRSO and/or premature ovarian insufficiency (POF). After 51 years of age,
      it is important to treat only women with important vasomotor symptoms, after the 
      failure of alternative therapies. Estrogens-only therapy plays a key role in
      hysterectomized women (HW). In the case of an intact uterus (UW), associations
      with the lowest dose of progestins/natural progesterone derivatives have to be
      preferred, as progestins has been shown to play an important role in BC
      transformation, especially in BRCA1mc. No studies have been performed in BRCAmc
      with regard to 'progestin-free' HT, in particular the old tibolone (both in HW
      and UW) and the new tissue-selective estrogen complex (in UW). However,
      preliminary data obtained from the general population are reassuring about the
      use of these 'progestin-free' preparations and BC safety.

AB  - Mutation of BRCA genes significantly increases the lifetime risk of breast,
      ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers. In addition to the
      increased risk of these multiple malignancies, the recent literature suggests
      that mutations in BRCA genes may lead to decreased reproductive potential. In
      this systematic review, we focus on the effect of BRCA gene mutation on
      reproductive potential. The main outcomes included the rate of nulliparity,
      ovarian reserve, ovarian response, and the age at natural menopause. A total of
      23 observational studies were included for quality analysis. The certainty of
      evidence was low to moderate: the main limitations were imprecision and
      statistically significant heterogeneity. Meta-analysis suggested that the rate of
      nulliparity, serum anti-mullerian hormone levels, antral follicle counts and
      ovarian response were not significantly affected in BRCA gene mutation carriers
      (P>0.05). BRCA gene mutation carriers tended to have a lower number of primordial
      follicles (P=0.0002) and lower age at natural menopause than non-carriers. In
      conclusion, there is no compelling evidence indicating that the rate of
      nulliparity, serum AMH, antral follicle counts and ovarian response are affected 
      in BRCA mutation carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For the past decades, number of prophylactic bilateral mastectomies
      using reconstruction with implants increases. We describe a new surgical strategy
      and analyse its safety and feasability. METHOD: It is a retrospective,
      descriptive and monocentric study. The first step of surgery consisted in
      obteining a peri-prosthetic capsule with implants and if there was a mammary
      hypertrophy and/or ptosis, it was corrected at the same time. The second step of 
      surgery was the nipple-sparing mastectomy with change of implants for bigger
      ones. Third step consisted in a lipofilling. RESULTS: Seven patients were
      included. 6 women had a BRCA1 gene mutation. Mean age was 35.6 year-old [29.6;
      41.6], mean BMI was 23.8kg/m(2) [20.6; 27], mean chest circumference was 93.7cm
      [87.4; 100], mean cup was C- [B-; D-]. 4 women had mammary hypertrophy and/or
      ptosis. Mean number of procedure per woman was 3.6 [2.5; 4.7]. Mean volume of
      implants used at the first step was 248.6ml [211.3; 285.9]. The second step was
      performed mean 33.9 weeks [22.3; 45.5] later. Mean increase of implants volume
      was 120ml [80.4; 159.6]. 4 patients had complications including 1 who had implant
      exposure. Six patients had lipofilling of mean volume per breast of 175ml [116;
      234]. CONCLUSION: This new strategy could decrease complication rate, improve
      aesthetic outcome and decrease psychological impact of surgery.

AB  - Some 5-10% of all breast cancers are associated with a pathogenic variant in a
      breast cancer-associated gene (BRCA1/BRCA2). Historically, with referral to the
      Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust's clinical genetics department for
      genetic testing, waiting times were on average 12-14 weeks for an initial
      appointment and 4-6 months to obtain results from the date of testing. A
      specialist, nurse-led mainstreaming cancer genetics (MCG) service was set up in
      the trust's Nottingham Breast Institute (NBI) to: reduce waiting times for the
      initial consultation, counselling, consent and obtaining results for BRCA1/BRCA2 
      gene testing; and to ensure appropriate patients with breast cancer were offered 
      genetic testing. Two breast clinical nurse specialists were trained so they could
      counsel, consent and give results for the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing directly to
      patients. Average waiting times for results from the time of testing were reduced
      to 35.8 days under the nurse-led service, which enabled oncologists and patients 
      to consider individual treatment options at an earlier time. The MCG service
      reduced waiting times, resulting in an improved, more streamlined service for
      patients undergoing genetic testing. The MCG service extended the scope of
      practice of the breast nurse clinical specialists, embedded an expert advanced
      nursing role in the breast multidisciplinary team and developed nurse mentoring
      opportunities.

TI  - The narrative paradox of the BRCA gene: an ethnographic study in the clinical
      encounters of ovarian cancer patients.

AB  - In this era of personalisation a patient's molecular profile plays an
      increasingly central role in development and delivery of personalised medicine.
      This paper sets out to explore the sociocultural implications of mainstreaming
      BRCA genetic testing in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer patients, who
      carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. It draws on ethnographic research conducted
      by between April-June 2016 in a large tertiary London hospital. Participant
      observation was conducted across two sites. For the first two weeks participant
      observation was conducted in the traditional genetic testing setting in two
      separate clinics. From thereon, participant observation was conducted in the
      clinical encounters of treating patients in the ovarian cancer clinic. In
      addition, face-to-face interviews were conducted with medical oncologists who
      worked in the clinic. Contributing to the fields of cancer genetics, personalised
      medicine and medical material culture studies in medical anthropology the paper
      seeks to further discussions about the interactions and relationships unfolding
      between medical objects and subjects across the landscape of cancer care. It
      highlights the importance of clinic-based ethnography to examine the complexities
      of identities and technologies as they intersect with the themes of suffering and
      hope in new and contradictory ways for BRCA-positive patients with late-stage
      disease. The paper argues that a BRCA mutation is not only central to the
      political economy of hope but takes on a more materialist nature as it becomes an
      embodied practice that moves in and beyond the clinic.

AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of TIL subpopulations, TLS, PD-1 and PD-L1
      in tumors from TNBC patients harboring wild-type or mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2
      germline genes. This TNBC cohort included 85% TIL-positive (>/=10%) tumors with
      21% classified as TIL(hi) (>/=50%). Interestingly, the BRCA(mut) group had a
      significantly higher incidence of TIL(pos) tumors compared to the BRCA(wt) group 
      (P=0.037). T cells were dominant in the infiltrate but no statistically
      significant differences were detected between BRCA(wt) and BRCA(mut) for CD3(+), 
      CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells or CD20(+) B cells. TLS were detected in 74% of tumors 
      but again no significant differences between the BRCA groups. PD-1 expression was
      observed in 33% and PD-L1 in 53% (any cell, cut-off >/=1%) tumors for the entire 
      TNBC cohort. PD-1 expression correlated with PD-L1 and both with TIL and TLS but 
      was not associated with BRCA mutational status. Our analyses reveal that BRCA(wt)
      and BRCA(mut) TNBC are similar except for a significant increase of TIL(pos)
      tumors in the BRCA(mut) group. While BRCA gene mutations may not directly drive
      immune infiltration, the greater number of TIL(pos) tumors could signal greater
      immunogenicity in this group.

PG  - 26-35
AB  - AIMS: To determine the proportion of eligible patients with high-grade serous
      carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum discussed at gynaecological 
      oncology multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs) in New Zealand and subsequently
      referred for genetic counselling and BRCA pathogenic variant testing. METHODS:
      Eligible cases were identified from Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and
      Dunedin gynaecologic oncology MDM databases between 1 January 2015 to 31 December
      2016. Patients who met the eligibility criteria for genetics referral were
      identified, and cross-referenced against genetic services databases to ascertain 
      the rates of referrals received, the numbers attending appointments, genetic
      testing offered and range of results. RESULTS: During the two-year period, 205
      patients were eligible for referral. Of these, 143 (70%) patients were referred
      for genetic counselling with 128 (90%) of this group recommended for BRCA
      pathogenic variant testing. Of the 126 who undertook the test, results were
      available for 120 (95%). Nineteen patients (16%) tested positive for a germline
      BRCA pathogenic variant. CONCLUSIONS: The New Zealand rate of referral to genetic
      counselling for women with high-grade serous cancer, (HGSC), of the ovary,
      fallopian tube or peritoneum diagnosed between 2015-2016 is encouraging when
      compared with others internationally. The rate of BRCA positive pathogenic
      variants is comparable to international data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: High background parenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular
      tissue on breast magnetic resonance imaging are related to increased breast
      cancer risk. This study sought to compare these parameters between BRCA mutation 
      carriers and non-carriers and to evaluate the potential implications of the
      findings for short term follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance
      imaging studies of known BRCA mutation carriers, were compared to age-matched
      non-carrier studies performed in the same center during the same period. The
      groups were compared for qualitative background parenchymal enhancement and
      amount of fibroglandular tissue using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data
      System (BI-RADS). RESULTS: Breast parenchymal enhancement was high in up to
      one-third of the cohort: 22% of carriers and 33% of controls (p=0.013). These
      results were sustained on separate analysis of menstrual-cycle-timed
      examinations. Amount of fibroglandular tissue was high in most cases: 62% of
      carriers and 75% of controls (p=0.004). A BI-RADS final assessment score of 3 was
      more common in patients with high parenchymal enhancement, especially controls.
      CONCLUSION: BRCA mutation carriers demonstrated lower levels of breast
      parenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular tissue than age-matched
      non-carriers. These differences are probably influenced by hormonal status, as
      well as highlight different risks in distinctive subgroups of breast cancer
      (hormone-enriched, mutation-associated defective DNA damage repair), affecting
      considerations of preventive medical treatment. Differences in the indications
      for imaging between the carrier and non-carrier groups (screening for mutations
      and breast cancer evaluation, respectively) probably accounted for the higher
      rate of BI-RADS 3 in the control group.

TI  - "Guys Don't Have Breasts": The Lived Experience of Men Who Have BRCA Gene
      Mutations and Are at Risk for Male Breast Cancer.
PG  - 961-972
LID - 10.1177/1557988317753241 [doi]
AB  - Men with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations are at increased risk of developing breast
      cancer and may have an indication for breast cancer screening using mammography. 
      Since breast cancer is often viewed as a woman's disease, visibilizing and
      understanding men's experience of having a BRCA mutation and specifically, of
      screening for breast cancer through mammography, were the objectives of this
      research study. The theoretical framework of interpretive phenomenology guided
      the process of data collection, coding, and analysis. Phenomenology is both a
      philosophy and research method which focuses on understanding the nature of
      experience from the perspectives of people experiencing a phenomenon, the essence
      of and commonalities among people's experiences, and the ways in which people
      experience the world through their bodies. Data were collected via in-depth
      interviews with a purposive sample of 15 male participants recruited from the
      Male Oncology Research and Education (MORE) Program. This article reports
      findings about participants' use of gender-specific language to describe their
      breasts, awareness of the ways in which their bodies changed overtime, and
      experiences of undergoing mammograms. This study is the first to describe men
      with BRCA's perceptions of their breasts and experiences of mammography in a
      high-risk cancer screening clinic. This study sheds light on an under-researched 
      area-breasts and masculinities-and could potentially lead to improved clinical
      understanding of men's embodied experiences of BRCA, as well as suggestions for
      improving the delivery of male breast cancer screening services.

TI  - Uptake of risk-reducing surgery in BRCA gene carriers in Wales, UK.
PG  - 580-585
LID - 10.1111/tbj.12978 [doi]
AB  - Women who inherit a mutated copy of the BRCA gene have a higher lifetime risk of 
      developing breast cancer. No large epidemiological studies exist looking at BRCA 
      mutation carriers in UK populations. All patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation
      identified between 1995 and 2015 were included. Individuals were identified from 
      a prospectively gathered data base. Genetics case-notes were obtained and
      retrospective analysis performed. 581 female BRCA mutation carriers were
      identified with a median age of 34 (18-81) at the time of testing. Of the 301
      women who underwent diagnostic testing (symptomatic) 246 had been diagnosed with 
      breast cancer, 89 with ovarian cancer and 37 had both at time of testing. Median 
      age at diagnostic test was 51 (25-81). 33% of women underwent risk-reducing
      mastectomies (RRM); median age at surgery 45. This compares with 37% of women in 
      this diagnostic group who underwent Risk-reducing bilateral
      salpingo-oopherectomies (RRBSO) at a median age of 46. Two hundred and eighty
      women underwent predictive testing (family history, asymptomatic), median age 36 
      (18-81). 34% of women in this predictive group underwent RRM, median age 37.
      There was a 29% uptake of RRBSO (median age 44 years). Fifteen women (5%)
      developed breast cancer after being tested; none of these had undergone RRS. This
      unique study of all BRCA mutation carriers in Wales shows considerable variation 
      in uptake of RRS. The decision to undergo RRS is complex and involves a number of
      factors, including a woman's age and life stage. As BRCA testing becomes more
      frequent and more gene mutation carriers are identified there will be significant
      implications for service allocation, screening demands, and provision of
      risk-reducing surgery for this high-risk patient group.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Treatment is chosen
      according to its hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2) status. Among the four main clinically set subtypes, hormone
      receptor-negative/HER2-negative subtype, also called triple-negative subtype
      (TNBC), is the most aggressive type with limited choices of therapy. However,
      recent research has provided important new insights into effective treatments for
      this subtype. One molecular target that has gained attention is the BRCA gene.
      BRCA proteins are involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity, therefore
      playing an important role as a "caretaker" DNA repair protein. Approximately 5%
      of all breast cancer patients are BRCA mutation carriers, and among the patients 
      with BRCA mutations, 57.1% have the clinical TNBC subtype, showing a high
      association between BRCA mutations and TNBCs. When cells lack either BRCA1 or
      BRCA2, all types of homology-directed repairs are compromised, and
      poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase (PARP) acts as a backup system to maintain the 
      genome, consequently making the cells highly sensitive to PARP1 inhibitors. PARP 
      inhibitors have shown promising activity in preclinical and early clinical
      trials, and today, phase III trials are ongoing. In this chapter, we discuss the 
      mechanism and the role of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated breast cancers and
      further elaborate the clinical potential of PARP inhibitors as well as their
      barriers.

      mainstay of treatment for breast cancers due to the increased risk of local
      recurrence. It is performed as a therapeutic, as well as prophylactic procedure. 
      However, mastectomy with removal of nipple areolar complex (NAC) is associated
      with adverse cosmetic outcome. NAC sparing mastectomy (NSM), which results in
      better cosmetic outcome, has been performed in non-BRCA mutation carriers. While 
      studies have shown that NSM is a oncologically safe in sporadic breast cancers,
      its application in BRCA mutation carriers is still controversial. Here we review 
      the existing evidence of NSM and its application in BRCA mutation carriers.

TI  - Pedigree and BRCA gene analysis in breast cancer patients to identify hereditary 
      breast and ovarian cancer syndrome to prevent morbidity and mortality of disease 
      in Indian population.

AB  - Global burden of breast cancer is expected to increase to >2 million new cases
      every year by 2030 and 10% of these are likely to have hereditary breast and
      ovarian cancer syndrome. Identifying these individuals by pedigree and BRCA1/2
      mutation analyses will enable us to offer targeted mutation testing and
      appropriate counseling. This study from a tertiary care hospital showed that of
      the 127 breast cancer patients on treatment during 2014-2015, 24 of them
      fulfilled the criteria of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome after
      detailed verbal autopsy and pedigree analysis, and BRCA1 and 2 next-generation
      sequencing done after pre-test counseling revealed mutations in 13 cases (54%),
      these included 9 BRCA1 mutations (69%) and 4 BRCA2 mutation (31%). Subsequent
      post-test counseling recommended targeted mutation analysis for 64 high-risk
      members in these 13 families with pathogenic mutations, which will help in
      surveillance for early detection, appropriate management, and prevention of the
      disease by decreasing the burden to both family and nation. Results from this
      preliminary study highlight the importance of genetic counseling, pedigree
      analysis, and genetic testing. It can be recommended that all oncology units
      should have a genetic counseling service for providing appropriate support to
      oncologists, patients, and families to prevent unnecessary testing; however,
      breast cancer screening program is incomplete without evaluating for hereditary
      breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

TI  - Do celebrity endorsements matter? Observational study of BRCA gene testing and
      mastectomy rates after Angelina Jolie's New York Times editorial.
PG  - i6357
LID - 10.1136/bmj.i6357 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect on BRCA testing and mastectomy rates of a widely
      viewed 2013 New York Times editorial by public figure Angelina Jolie that
      endorsed BRCA testing and announced Jolie's decision to undergo preventive
      mastectomy. DESIGN: Observational study with difference-in-difference analysis.
      SETTING: Commercially insured US population. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 18-64 years
      with claims in the Truven MarketScan commercial claims database (n=9 532 836).
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in BRCA testing rates in the 15 business days
      before versus after 14 May 2013 (editorial date) compared with the change in the 
      same period in 2012; mastectomy rates in the months before and after publication,
      both overall and within 60 days of BRCA testing among women who were tested;
      national estimates of incremental tests and expenditures associated with Jolie's 
      article in the 15 days after publication. RESULTS: Daily BRCA test rates
      increased immediately after the 2013 editorial, from 0.71 tests/100 000 women in 
      the 15 business days before to 1.13 tests/100 000 women in the 15 business days
      after publication. In comparison, daily test rates were similar in the same
      period in 2012 (0.58/100 000 women in the 15 business days before 14 May versus
      0.55/100 000 women in the 15 business days after), implying a
      difference-in-difference absolute daily increase of 0.45 tests/100 000 women or a
      64% relative increase (P<0.001). The editorial was associated with an estimated
      increase of 4500 BRCA tests and $13.5m ( pound10.8m; euro12.8) expenditure
      nationally among commercially insured adult women in those 15 days. Increased
      BRCA testing rates were sustained throughout 2013. Overall mastectomy rates
      remained unchanged in the months after publication, but 60 day mastectomy rates
      among women who had a BRCA test fell from 10% in the months before publication to
      7% in the months after publication, suggesting that women who underwent tests as 
      a result of to the editorial had a lower pre-test probability of having the BRCA 
      mutation than women tested before the editorial. CONCLUSIONS: Celebrity
      endorsements can have a large and immediate effect on use of health services.
      Such announcements can be a low cost means of reaching a broad audience quickly, 
      but they may not effectively target the subpopulations that are most at risk for 
      the relevant underlying condition.

TI  - Detection of false positive mutations in BRCA gene by next generation sequencing.
PG  - 311-317
LID - 10.1007/s10689-016-9955-8 [doi]
AB  - BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are implicated in 20-25% of hereditary breast and ovarian
      cancers. New age sequencing platforms have revolutionized massively parallel
      sequencing in clinical practice by providing cost effective, rapid, and sensitive
      sequencing. This study critically evaluates the false positives in multiplex
      panels and suggests the need for careful analysis. We employed multiplex PCR
      based BRCA1 and BRCA2 community Panel with ion torrent PGM machine for evaluation
      of these mutations. Out of all 41samples analyzed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 five were
      found with 950_951 insA(Asn319fs) at Chr13:32906565 position and one sample with 
      1032_1033 insA(Asn346fs) at Chr13:32906647, both being frame-shift mutations in
      BRCA2 gene. 950_951 insA(Asn319fs) mutation is reported as pathogenic allele in
      NCBI dbSNP. On examination of IGV for all these samples, it was seen that both
      mutations had 'A' nucleotide insertion at 950, and 1032 position in exon 10 of
      BRCA2 gene. Sanger Sequencing did not confirm these insertions. Next-generation
      sequencing shows great promise by allowing rapid mutational analysis of multiple 
      genes in human cancer but our results indicate the need for careful sequence
      analysis to avoid false positive results.

TI  - BRCA Share: A Collection of Clinical BRCA Gene Variants.
PG  - 1318-1328
LID - 10.1002/humu.23113 [doi]
AB  - As next-generation sequencing increases access to human genetic variation, the
      challenge of determining clinical significance of variants becomes ever more
      acute. Germline variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can confer substantial
      lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Assessment of variant pathogenicity
      is a vital part of clinical genetic testing for these genes. A database of
      clinical observations of BRCA variants is a critical resource in that process.
      This article describes BRCA Share, a database created by a unique international
      alliance of academic centers and commercial testing laboratories. By integrating 
      the content of the Universal Mutation Database generated by the French Unicancer 
      Genetic Group with the testing results of two large commercial laboratories,
      Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp), BRCA Share has
      assembled one of the largest publicly accessible collections of BRCA variants
      currently available. Although access is available to academic researchers without
      charge, commercial participants in the project are required to pay a support fee 
      and contribute their data. The fees fund the ongoing curation effort, as well as 
      planned experiments to functionally characterize variants of uncertain
      significance. BRCA Share databases can therefore be considered as models of
      successful data sharing between private companies and the academic world.

AB  - Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation have substantially higher risk for
      developing not only breast and ovarian cancers, but also for primary peritoneal, 
      Fallopian tube, colonic, pancreatic cancers, uterine papillary serous
      adenocarcinoma and malignant melanoma. The risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 39
      to 49% by 70 years of age in BRCA1 mutation carriers and from 11 to 18% for those
      with a BRCA2 mutation, whilst breast cancer increases similarly within women who 
      have either the BRCA1 mutation or the BRCA2 mutation, from about 20% in women in 
      their forties, 37% by the age of 50 years, 55% by 60 years and more than 70% by
      the age of 70 years. Prophylactic risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
      (RRBSO) provides significantly greater benefits with the view of reducing the
      risk for gynecological and breast cancer (decreasing ovarian cancer risk by
      85-95%, breast cancer risk by about 53-68% and removes occult or undetected
      cancers in 2-18% of such women) compared to other conservative options, namely
      screening/surveillance or use of chemopreventative agents. RRBSO will result in
      significant menopausal symptoms, increased risk for bone mineral loss, increasing
      risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Risk for
      cardiovascular disease is also increased if the procedure is performed in women
      less than 50 years of age. This article analyzes the role of RRBSO in women with 
      BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations with no personal history of breast cancer and the impact of
      hormone therapy on risk for breast and gynecological cancers if used after the
      procedure to alleviate the resulting menopausal symptoms.

TI  - Adding In Silico Assessment of Potential Splice Aberration to the Integrated
      Evaluation of BRCA Gene Unclassified Variants.
PG  - 627-39
LID - 10.1002/humu.22973 [doi]
AB  - Clinical mutation screening of the cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2
      generates many unclassified variants (UVs). Most of these UVs are either rare
      missense substitutions or nucleotide substitutions near the splice junctions of
      the protein coding exons. Previously, we developed a quantitative method for
      evaluation of BRCA gene UVs-the "integrated evaluation"-that combines a sequence 
      analysis-based prior probability of pathogenicity with patient and/or tumor
      observational data to arrive at a posterior probability of pathogenicity. One
      limitation of the sequence analysis-based prior has been that it evaluates UVs
      from the perspective of missense substitution severity but not probability to
      disrupt normal mRNA splicing. Here, we calibrated output from the splice-site
      fitness program MaxEntScan to generate spliceogenicity-based prior probabilities 
      of pathogenicity for BRCA gene variants; these range from 0.97 for variants with 
      high probability to damage a donor or acceptor to 0.02 for exonic variants that
      do not impact a splice junction and are unlikely to create a de novo donor. We
      created a database http://priors.hci.utah.edu/PRIORS/ that provides the combined 
      missense substitution severity and spliceogenicity-based probability of
      pathogenicity for BRCA gene single-nucleotide substitutions. We also updated the 
      BRCA gene Ex-UV LOVD, available at http://hci-exlovd.hci.utah.edu, with 77
      re-evaluable variants.

TI  - DNA stabilization by the upregulation of estrogen signaling in BRCA gene mutation
      carriers.
PG  - 2663-75
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S84437 [doi]
AB  - Currently available scientific evidence erroneously suggests that mutagenic
      weakness or loss of the BRCA1/2 genes may liberate the proliferative effects of
      estrogen signaling, which provokes DNA damage and genomic instability.
      Conversely, BRCA mutation seems to be an imbalanced defect, crudely inhibiting
      the upregulation of estrogen receptor expression and liganded transcriptional
      activity, whereas estrogen receptor-repressor functions become predominant. In
      BRCA-proficient cases, estrogen signaling orchestrates the activity of cell
      proliferation and differentiation with high safety, while upregulating the
      expression and DNA-stabilizing impact of BRCA genes. In turn, BRCA proteins
      promote estrogen signaling by proper estrogen synthesis via CYP19 gene regulation
      and by induction of the appropriate expression and transcriptional activity of
      estrogen receptors. In this exquisitely organized regulatory system, the
      dysfunction of each player may jeopardize genome stability and lead to severe
      chronic diseases, such as cancer development. Female organs, such as breast,
      endometrium, and ovary, exhibiting regular cyclic proliferative activity are
      particularly vulnerable in case of disturbances in either estrogen signaling or
      BRCA-mediated DNA repair. BRCA mutation carrier women may apparently be healthy
      or exhibit clinical signs of deficient estrogen signaling in spite of
      hyperestrogenism. Even women who enjoy sufficient compensatory DNA-defending
      activities are at risk of tumor development because many endogenous and
      environmental factors may jeopardize the mechanisms of extreme compensatory
      processes. Natural estrogens have numerous benefits in tumor prevention and
      therapy even in BRCA mutation carriers. There are no toxic effects even in
      sky-high doses and all physiologic cellular functions are strongly upregulated,
      while malignant tumor cells are recognized and killed in a Janus-faced manner.

AB  - Familial breast cancer accounts for 5-10% of all breast cancers. Due to BRCA1/2
      tumour suppressor gene mutation, hereditary breast and ovarian syndrome is the
      most common form. Risk-reducing gynaecological and breast surgery is offered to
      such patients in ever-increasing numbers. Hence, the development of a
      multi-specialty combined treatment approach is called for. Twenty-two BRCA
      gene-mutation carrier women underwent one-stage gynaecological and breast
      risk-reducing surgery and immediate reconstruction between January 2005 and
      December 2011 at the Belfast City Hospital. Their mean age was 41.2 years (median
      41 years). Nearly half of the patients were BRCA2 and a quarter were BRCA1
      carriers. The rest were positive for both genes. Hormone-replacement therapy was 
      initiated in 14 women. Average theatre time and stay in the hospital were three
      hours and two and a half days, respectively. Two patients developed complications
      unrelated to combining the procedures. Both were treated conservatively and
      recovered. The one-stage approach logically proves economical by limiting the
      time the patients are in the hospital and away from work. We describe our
      multidisciplinary team service that is offering safe and economical one-stage
      risk-reducing surgery and reconstruction to young BRCA gene-mutation carrier
      women in Northern Ireland.

PG  - 54-8

AB  - Thousands of individuals have undergone mutational analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2.
      The Ohio State University Clinical Cancer Genetics program has identified 466
      individuals from 289 families with a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Excluding
      Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations, we observed 9 deleterious BRCA mutations five
      or more times in ostensibly unrelated families and another 13 mutations in 3-4
      families. We hypothesized that some of the rarer recurrent mutations observed in 
      our population were due to different branches of the same family being tested
      independently without knowledge of previous testing of relatives. We examined 90 
      pedigrees for individuals with the same mutations that were seen three or more
      times for shared reported family medical history or surnames. Familial links were
      made in four instances out of a total of 22 shared mutations despite the fact
      that individuals were not aware that another family member had been tested. As
      more individuals undergo BRCA testing, we propose that this phenomenon will
      become more common. Being unaware of previous testing in a family not only
      affects the risk assessment but also likely increases the costs associated with
      the genetic testing and subsequent cancer screening in many cases.

TI  - Requirement of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C for BRCA gene expression
      and homologous recombination.
PG  - e61368
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0061368 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNP C) is a core
      component of 40S ribonucleoprotein particles that bind pre-mRNAs and influence
      their processing, stability and export. Breast cancer tumor suppressors BRCA1,
      BRCA2 and PALB2 form a complex and play key roles in homologous recombination
      (HR), DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and cell cycle regulation following
      DNA damage. METHODS: PALB2 nucleoprotein complexes were isolated using tandem
      affinity purification from nuclease-solubilized nuclear fraction.
      Immunofluorescence was used for localization studies of proteins. siRNA-mediated 
      gene silencing and flow cytometry were used for studying DNA repair efficiency
      and cell cycle distribution/checkpoints. The effect of hnRNP C on mRNA abundance 
      was assayed using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. RESULTS AND
      SIGNIFICANCE: We identified hnRNP C as a component of a nucleoprotein complex
      containing breast cancer suppressor proteins PALB2, BRCA2 and BRCA1. Notably,
      other components of the 40S ribonucleoprotein particle were not present in the
      complex. hnRNP C was found to undergo significant changes of sub-nuclear
      localization after ionizing radiation (IR) and to partially localize to DNA
      damage sites. Depletion of hnRNP C substantially altered the normal balance of
      repair mechanisms following DSB induction, reducing HR usage in particular, and
      impaired S phase progression after IR. Moreover, loss of hnRNP C strongly reduced
      the abundance of key HR proteins BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and BRIP1, which can be
      attributed, at least in part, to the downregulation of their mRNAs due to
      aberrant splicing. Our results establish hnRNP C as a key regulator of BRCA gene 
      expression and HR-based DNA repair. They also suggest the existence of an RNA
      regulatory program at sites of DNA damage, which involves a unique function of
      hnRNP C that is independent of the 40S ribonucleoprotein particles and most other
      hnRNP proteins.

      among women with BRCA gene mutation.
PG  - 621-8

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify factors that affect the decision to
      undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations
      carriers in South Korea. The medical records of 124 women who had been found to
      have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation at our institution between May 2003 and
      December 2011 were reviewed. The carriers were divided into RRSO and non-RRSO
      groups for comparison of their clinicopathologic, socio-economic, and
      psychosocial factors. Of the 71 carriers eligible for RRSO, 21 had undergone
      RRSO. In univariate analysis, classification of carriers into 3 groups by decade 
      of life (4th, 5th, or 6th and later decade) and subsequent analysis revealed that
      52.6% of carriers in the 5th decade had undergone RRSO, a rate significantly
      higher than that of the other age groups (p = 0.007). The RRSO rate was higher in
      carriers with a personal history of breast cancer than in those without (39.2%
      vs. 5.0%, p = 0.004), in carriers with a family history of breast cancer than in 
      those without (35.5% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.065), and in carriers with a family history
      of ovarian cancer than in those carriers without a family history (66.7% vs.
      24.2%, p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis identified age and personal history of
      breast cancer as independent factors affecting the decision to undergo RRSO. Age 
      and personal history of breast cancer are important factors in the decision to
      undergo, and should thus be considered when counseling BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

AB  - An association of preferential X chromosome inactivation (XCI) with BRCA gene
      status and breast/ovarian cancer risk has been reported. We evaluated XCI in a
      large group of BRCA mutation carriers compared to non-carriers and investigated
      associations between preferential XCI (90:10) and age, mutated gene, cancer
      development and chemotherapy. XCI was analysed by human androgen receptor
      (HUMARA) assay and pyrosequencing in 437 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers and 445
      age-matched controls. The distribution of XCI patterns in the two groups was
      compared by logistic regression analysis. The association between preferential
      XCI and selected variables was investigated in both univariate and multivariate
      fashion. In univariate analyses preferential XCI was not significantly associated
      with the probability of being a BRCA mutation carrier, nor with cancer status,
      whereas chemotherapeutic regime and age both showed a significant association. In
      multivariate analysis only age maintained significance (odds ratio, 1.056; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.016-1.096). Our findings do not support the usefulness of 
      XCI analysis for the identification of BRCA mutation carriers and cancer risk
      assessment. The increasing preferential XCI frequency with ageing and the
      association with chemotherapy justify extending the investigation to other
      categories of female cancer patients to identify possible X-linked loci
      implicated in cell survival.

TI  - Recognizing BRCA gene mutation risk subsequent to breast cancer diagnosis in
      southwestern Ontario.
PG  - e258-66
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the population of women in southwestern Ontario who were
      diagnosed with potentially preventable BRCA mutation-related breast cancer.
      DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: The Cancer Genetics Clinic of the
      London Regional Cancer Program in London, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Patients younger
      than 52 years of age who were referred to the London Regional Cancer Program
      Cancer Genetics Clinic between 1997 and 2007 for BRCA testing after being
      diagnosed with breast cancer (N = 1017). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of
      women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations and the proportion of women who would
      have qualified, based on family cancer history, for referral for genetic
      counseling and testing before their breast cancer diagnoses. RESULTS: Among the
      1017 women referred for BRCA testing, 63 women younger than 52 years of age who
      had been diagnosed with breast cancer were found, subsequent to this diagnosis,
      to have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. Of these, 41 (65%) had family cancer
      histories that would have qualified them for genetic counseling and testing,
      according to provincial criteria, before their own breast cancer diagnoses. Of
      the 63 women, most (81%) had been referred for BRCA gene mutation testing by
      their oncologists or surgeons. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the diagnosis
      of breast cancer could have been anticipated, and perhaps in some cases
      prevented, in up to two-thirds of high-risk women younger than 52 years of age in
      southwestern Ontario. If the high-risk status of these women had been recognized,
      they might have had the opportunity to choose genetic counseling, testing, more
      effective cancer surveillance, and potentially preventive options. The results of
      this study call for increased public and care provider awareness about hereditary
      breast cancer risk to promote women's ability to choose to access genetic
      counseling.

AB  - Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are showing considerable promise for
      the treatment of BRCA mutation-associated ovarian and breast cancer. This
      approach exploits a synthetic lethal strategy to target the specific DNA repair
      pathway in cancers that harbor mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
      Accumulating evidence suggests that PARP inhibitors may have a wider application 
      in the treatment of sporadic, high-grade serous ovarian cancers and other cancers
      including endometrial cancer. In this review, we discuss the clinical development
      of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and explore challenges that need to be
      addressed if the full potential of these agents is to be realized.

AB  - The variable penetrance of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes suggests that other genetic 
      or environmental factors may interact with these mutations to modify breast
      cancer risk. The objective of this study was to measure departures from
      multiplicative effects of alcohol consumption and BRCA gene mutations. A cohort
      of French-Canadian breast cancer patients was tested for BRCA gene mutations and 
      completed a food frequency questionnaire. The case-only odds ratio (COR) was
      calculated. A total of 857 women, including 10 BRCA1 and 33 BRCA2 mutation
      carriers, participated in the study. No significant interaction between alcohol
      consumption and BRCA1 mutations was detected, although the interaction with wine 
      consumption suggested a sub-multiplicative effect (COR = 0.38, 95% CI:
      0.08-1.81). Consumption of alcohol other than wine interacted significantly with 
      BRCA2 mutations (COR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.03-4.49). Consumption of wine may protect 
      against BRCA1-associated tumors, while women with BRCA2 mutations may be at
      greater risk of alcohol-induced breast cancer.

TI  - Clinical implications for BRCA gene mutation in breast cancer.
PG  - 3097-102
LID - 10.1007/s11033-011-1073-y [doi]
AB  - To investigate the mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and determine whether
      clinic-pathological factors related to BRCA gene mutation. Mastectomy specimens
      from 360 breast cancers were enrolled and examined in the study. The relationship
      between BRCA gene mutation and clinic-pathological factors was evaluated.
      Overall, 280 patients were BRCA negative and 80 got BRCA gene mutation.
      Triple-negative breast cancers--i.e., breast cancers that do not express estrogen
      receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) or human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2/neu)--was observed in 53.85% of the BRCA1 mutation patients, in 
      28.57% of the BRCA2 mutation cases, while 14.29% of BRCA negative patients. BRCA1
      mutation patients got a heavy lymph node metastasis and higher nuclear grade
      tumors than the others (P = 0.004, 0.007). Furthermore, BRCA mutation was also
      found to be significantly related to ER, PR and HER2/neu status (P < 0.05). BRCA1
      expression was not associated with breast cancer-specific survival in the
      triple-negative breast cancers (P = 0.742). After Cox regression, BRCA1 mutation 
      was not shown to be an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer. These
      findings substantiated the possibility of tumors associated with BRCA1 mutations 
      divided into two distinct groups, triple-negative and non-triple-negative groups 
      requires further investigation.

PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1097/PPO.0b013e3181cf0204 [doi]
AB  - Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are characterized by deficient
      repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. Defective DNA
      double-strand break repair has been not only implicated as a key contributor to
      tumorigenesis in mutation carriers but also represents a potential target for
      therapy. The transcriptional similarities between BRCA1-deficient tumors and
      sporadic tumors of the basal-like subtype have led to the investigation of
      homologous recombination repair-directed therapy in triple-negative tumors, which
      demonstrates overlap with the basal-like subtype. We broaden the scope of this
      topic by addressing a "repair-defective" rather than "BRCA1-like" phenotype. We
      discuss structural and functional aspects of key repair proteins including BRCA1,
      BRCA2, BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1, and partner and localizer
      of BRCA2 and describe the phenotypic consequences of their loss at the cellular, 
      tissue, and organism level. We review potential mechanisms of repair pathway
      dysfunction in sporadic tumors and address how the identification of such defects
      may guide the application of repair-directed therapies.

AB  - We performed presymptomatic carrier detection by BRCA gene testing of the family 
      members of three familial breast cancer kindred diagnosed with pathogenetic
      mutation in BRCA genes. All members were over 20 years of age. We explained
      familial breast cancer and BRCA gene testing, and obtained autonomic consent
      before gene testing. Genetic testing revealed twins in a family were dizygotic.
      In another family bilateral breast cancer occurred in a carrier after five years 
      of genetic testing. Carriers are at high risk of breast cancer and have to
      receive breast cancer screening and familial tumor counseling. Non-carriers are
      at the same risk of breast cancer as the general population.

      BRCA1 and BRCA2 can have emotional consequences for both the tested individual
      and his or her relatives. This secondary analysis study investigated how BRCA
      testing impacts family dynamics and relationships. For the original study, a
      grounded theory inquiry, participants were recruited from a hereditary
      breast/ovarian cancer syndrome support website and open-ended interviews were
      performed asking about individual and family experiences after BRCA testing. All 
      12 participants whose interviews were included in the secondary analysis had a
      BRCA mutation. For the secondary analysis, thematic analysis was conducted and
      revealed three main themes characterizing the effect of BRCA testing on family
      relationships: 1. That the first in the family to have testing or seek genetic
      counseling takes on a special family role that can be difficult for them; 2. That
      discussions in the family often change; and 3. That individuals may feel more or 
      less connected to certain family members. These changes seemed to relate to
      family cancer history, relationships, coping strategies, communication patterns, 
      and mutation status. Genetic counselors might find it useful to explore these
      issues in order to prepare clients before BRCA testing and to support them
      through shifts in family dynamics after disclosure of results.

AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high
      cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including
      microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb. Here we present cDNA 
      sequences, genetic mapping, and genomic analyses for the four previously
      undescribed zebrafish FA genes (fanci, fancj, fancm, and fancn), and show that
      they reverted to single copy after the teleost genome duplication. We tested the 
      hypothesis that FA genes are expressed during embryonic development in tissues
      that are disrupted in human patients by investigating fanc gene expression
      patterns. We found fanc gene maternal message, which can provide Fanc proteins to
      repair DNA damage encountered in rapid cleavage divisions. Zygotic expression was
      broad but especially strong in eyes, central nervous system and hematopoietic
      tissues. In the pectoral fin bud at hatching, fanc genes were expressed
      specifically in the apical ectodermal ridge, a signaling center for fin/limb
      development that may be relevant to the radius/thumb anomaly of FA patients.
      Hatching embryos expressed fanc genes strongly in the oral epithelium, a site of 
      squamous cell carcinomas in FA patients. Larval and adult zebrafish expressed
      fanc genes in proliferative regions of the brain, which may be related to
      microcephaly in FA. Mature ovaries and testes expressed fanc genes in specific
      stages of oocyte and spermatocyte development, which may be related to DNA repair
      during homologous recombination in meiosis and to infertility in human patients. 
      The intestine strongly expressed some fanc genes specifically in proliferative
      zones. Our results show that zebrafish has a complete complement of fanc genes in
      single copy and that these genes are expressed in zebrafish embryos and adults in
      proliferative tissues that are often affected in FA patients. These results
      support the notion that zebrafish offers an attractive experimental system to
      help unravel mechanisms relevant not only to FA, but also to breast cancer, given
      the involvement of fancj (brip1), fancn (palb2) and fancd1 (brca2) in both
      conditions.

AB  - Empirical and clinical literature suggests a temporal thread running through
      family narratives of hereditary disease, linking past experiences to current
      beliefs about risk. This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing
      hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer
      and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family
      development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration
      completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts
      were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key
      themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct
      priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have
      children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to
      have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at
      finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer
      world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further,
      participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve
      desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer
      diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery. Clinical practice and research
      implications are discussed.

LID - 10.1177/09697330080150041201 [doi]
AB  - Persons exhibiting mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have
      a greatly increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. The
      incidence of BRCA gene mutation is very high in Ashkenazi Jewish women of
      European descent, and many issues can arise, particularly for observant Orthodox 
      women, because of their genetic status. Their obligations under the Jewish code
      of ethics, referred to as Jewish law, with respect to the acceptability of
      various risk-reducing strategies, may be poorly understood. In this article the
      moral direction that Jewish law gives to women regarding testing,
      confidentiality, and other issues is explored. The intent is to broaden nurses'
      knowledge of how a particular religious tradition could impact on decision making
      around genetics testing, with the aim of enhancing their understanding of
      culturally sensitive ethical care.

TI  - Limited family structure and BRCA gene mutation status in single cases of breast 
      cancer.
PG  - 2587-95
AB  - CONTEXT: An autosomal dominant pattern of hereditary breast cancer may be masked 
      by small family size or transmission through males given sex-limited expression. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine if BRCA gene mutations are more prevalent among single
      cases of early onset breast cancer in families with limited vs adequate family
      structure than would be predicted by currently available probability models.
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1543 women seen at US high-risk
      clinics for genetic cancer risk assessment and BRCA gene testing were enrolled in
      a prospective registry study between April 1997 and February 2007. Three hundred 
      six of these women had breast cancer before age 50 years and no first- or
      second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The
      main outcome measure was whether family structure, assessed from
      multigenerational pedigrees, predicts BRCA gene mutation status. Limited family
      structure was defined as fewer than 2 first- or second-degree female relatives
      surviving beyond age 45 years in either lineage. Family structure effect and
      mutation probability by the Couch, Myriad, and BRCAPRO models were assessed with 
      stepwise multiple logistic regression. Model sensitivity and specificity were
      determined and receiver operating characteristic curves were generated. RESULTS: 
      Family structure was limited in 153 cases (50%). BRCA gene mutations were
      detected in 13.7% of participants with limited vs 5.2% with adequate family
      structure. Family structure was a significant predictor of mutation status (odds 
      ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.73; P = .02). Although none of the
      models performed well, receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that 
      modification of BRCAPRO output by a corrective probability index accounting for
      family structure was the most accurate BRCA gene mutation status predictor (area 
      under the curve, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.81; P<.001) for single
      cases of breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Family structure can affect the accuracy of 
      mutation probability models. Genetic testing guidelines may need to be more
      inclusive for single cases of breast cancer when the family structure is limited 
      and probability models need to be recreated using limited family history as an
      actual variable.

TI  - Sonographic features of breast carcinoma presenting as masses in BRCA gene
      mutation carriers.
PG  - 817-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the sonographic features of
      breast cancer gene BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast carcinomas in comparison
      with "sporadic" breast carcinomas and benign breast masses. METHODS: Sonograms of
      233 breast masses, including 33 BRCA-associated malignant masses (BRCA1, 15;
      BRCA2, 18), 148 sporadic malignant masses, and 52 benign masses, were reviewed by
      consensus by 2 radiologists according to American College of Radiology Breast
      Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) terminology. RESULTS: Most of the
      sporadic and BRCA1-and BRCA2-associated cancers displayed an irregular shape
      (91.2%, 93.3%, and 83.3%, respectively). BRCA1-associated cancers showed
      microlobulated margins in 53.3% versus 33.8% (sporadic) and 33.3% (BRCA2). A
      parallel orientation was most frequently encountered in BRCA1-associated lesions 
      (46.7%) versus sporadic (33.8%) and BRCA2 (33.3%), whereas posterior acoustic
      shadowing was least frequently seen in BRCA1-associated lesions (13.3%) versus
      BRCA2 (16.7%) and sporadic (31.1%). Most (73.3%) of the BRCA1-associated lesions 
      were classified as BI-RADS category 4, whereas most of the sporadic and
      BRCA2-associated lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (66.2% and 72.2%).
      CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic features of BRCA-associated and sporadic breast
      carcinomas do not differ substantially. BRCA1-associated breast carcinomas trend 
      toward less malignant sonographic characteristics, but strict application of the 
      BI-RADS categorizations demands that they be classified as category 4 or 5.

TI  - Views of BRCA gene mutation carriers on preimplantation genetic diagnosis as a
      reproductive option for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
PG  - 1573-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: In May 2006, the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority
      (HFEA) approved use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for lower
      penetrance, late onset cancer susceptibility syndromes such as hereditary breast 
      and ovarian cancer (HBOC). This is the first report on views of BRCA gene
      mutation carriers on use of PGD for HBOC. METHODS: Between December 2005 and
      February 2006, a postal survey of BRCA mutation carriers attending a Familial
      Cancer Clinic was undertaken. RESULTS: Of 102 women sent questionnaires, 52 (51%)
      responded. Thirty-nine (75%) felt it was acceptable to offer PGD for HBOC.
      Fifteen (37.5%) of 40 who had completed their families would personally have
      considered PGD if it had been available. Only one of seven (14%) contemplating a 
      future pregnancy would consider PGD. Eighteen (35%) wrote extensively about their
      concerns including increasing availability of effective treatment and good
      quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of BRCA gene mutation carriers are
      supportive of offering PGD to others, thus endorsing the HFEA decision. However, 
      most women would not consider it personally. Concerns raised highlight the need
      for regular HFEA reviews of the licensing criteria, as HBOC may cease to be a
      "serious life threatening illness" in the future.

TI  - Moving genetics into clinical cancer care: examples from BRCA gene testing and
      telemedicine.
PG  - S65-70
AB  - The translation of genetic knowledge from the research laboratory into the
      clinical arena is a complex and challenging process. The skills and expertise
      required are different from those required by a successful laboratory scientist. 
      Recognising the scale of the challenge, University College London has established
      the Institute of Human Genetics and Health; a unique, multi-disciplinary
      initiative examining the impact of genetic knowledge on human health and disease.
      The testing of the BRCA1 and 2 genes in the North East Thames region is an
      interesting example of the translation of genetic testing into clinical care, and
      the corresponding complexities relating to informed consent that can arise. The
      development of a remote cancer genetics service within North East Thames Regional
      Genetics Service, which uses live, real time teleconferencing technology, is a
      powerful example of the fact that the National Health Service (NHS) can adapt,
      and integrate new technology into its working practice.

TI  - Gene promoter hypermethylation in ductal lavage fluid from healthy BRCA gene
      mutation carriers and mutation-negative controls.
PG  - R20
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Female germline BRCA gene mutation carriers are at increased risk
      for developing breast cancer. The purpose of our study was to establish whether
      healthy BRCA mutation carriers demonstrate an increased frequency of aberrant
      gene promoter hypermethylation in ductal lavage (DL) fluid, compared with
      predictive genetic test negative controls, that might serve as a surrogate marker
      of BRCA1/2 mutation status and/or breast cancer risk. METHODS: The pattern of CpG
      island hypermethylation within the promoter region of a panel of four genes
      (RAR-beta, HIN-1, Twist and Cyclin D2) was assessed by methylation-specific
      polymerase chain reaction using free DNA extracted from DL fluid. RESULTS:
      Fifty-one DL samples from 24 healthy women of known BRCA mutation status (7 BRCA1
      mutation carriers, 12 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 5 controls) were available for 
      methylation analysis. Eight of 19 (42.1%) BRCA mutation carriers were found to
      have at least one hypermethylated gene in the four-gene panel. Two BRCA mutation 
      carriers, in whom aberrant methylation was found, also had duct epithelial cell
      atypia identified. No hypermethylation was found in DL samples from 5 negative
      controls (p = 0.13). CONCLUSION: We found substantial levels of aberrant
      methylation, with the use of a four-gene panel, in the fluid from the breasts of 
      healthy BRCA mutation carriers compared with controls. Methylation analysis of
      free DNA in DL fluid may offer a useful surrogate marker for BRCA1/2 mutation
      status and/or breast cancer risk. Further studies are required for the evaluation
      of the specificity and predictive value of aberrant methylation in DL fluid for
      future breast cancer development in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

TI  - Occurrence of both breast and ovarian cancer in a woman is a marker for the BRCA 
      gene mutations: a population-based study from western Sweden.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to analyze whether the occurrence of both breast and
      ovarian cancer in a woman serves as a marker for BRCA gene mutations. MATERIAL
      AND METHODS: This population-based study included 256 women in western Sweden who
      developed both invasive breast and ovarian tumors between 1958 and 1999. Archival
      paraffin tissue blocks of their tumors were retrieved for DNA-extraction to
      analyze the founder mutation, BRCA1 c.3171_3175dup (c.3171ins5), which is most
      common in this geographic area and four other common Scandinavian BRCA1 gene
      mutations and one BRCA2 mutation. Together, account these mutations for
      approximately 75% of the BRCA1/2 gene mutations in the clinical unit. RESULTS:
      Ninteen percent (95% confidence interval (CI) 14-24%) of the women carried one of
      the analyzed BRCA1 gene mutations but none of the women were positive for the
      analyzed BRCA2 mutation. One-third of the women with both tumors before age 60
      were mutation carriers. BRCA1 c.3171_3175dup (c.3171ins5) constituted 84% of all 
      identified mutations. Although the majority of breast cancers were invasive
      ductal and atypical medullary types, a variety of other breast malignancies were 
      seen among mutation carriers. Serous ovarian carcinomas predominated among
      ovarian tumors. A variety of other ovarian tumors, including three
      granulosa-theca cell tumors, were also observed among mutation carriers.
      CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of both breast and ovarian cancer in a woman is
      associated with a high likelihood of a constitutional BRCA1 mutation. These women
      and their families might therefore be considered for mutation screening after
      appropriate genetic counselling.

TI  - Loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci detected in ductal lavage
      fluid from BRCA gene mutation carriers and controls.
PG  - 1399-402
AB  - Female BRCA gene mutation carriers are at increased risk for developing breast
      cancer. Ductal lavage is a novel method for sampling breast ductal fluid,
      providing epithelial cells for cytologic assessment and a source of free DNA for 
      molecular analyses. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BRCA loci in ductal
      lavage fluid is a potential biomarker of breast cancer risk. The LOH rate was
      measured at the BRCA1/2 loci and compared with that at a control locus (APC)
      using free DNA from the ductal lavage fluid of BRCA carriers and predictive test 
      negative controls. We evaluated the reproducibility of these analyses. Free DNA
      sufficient for PCR amplification was obtained from 33 ductal lavage samples of 17
      healthy women of known BRCA status (14 BRCA carriers and 3 controls). LOH rates
      of 36.4% to 56.3% at the BRCA1 locus and 45% to 61.5% at the BRCA2 locus were
      found among BRCA carriers. The LOH rate at the APC locus was lower (18.5%). The
      interaliquot reproducibility for the D17S855 marker of the BRCA1 locus was 66.7%.
      Intraaliquot reproducibility was 90%. Although we successfully isolated
      sufficient free DNA from ductal lavage fluid for PCR amplification, the degree of
      reproducibility of these LOH studies raises questions about the robustness of
      this technique as a risk assessment tool in the evaluation of high-risk women.
      Further studies are required to evaluate the specificity and predictive value of 
      LOH in ductal lavage fluid for breast cancer development.

TI  - The European opposition against the BRCA gene patents.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - In 2001, the European Patent Organisation (EPO) granted 3 patents on the BRCA1
      gene (EP-B-699754, EP-B-705903, EP-B-705902) to Myriad Genetics. The patents, and
      the option of the patent holder to strictly exert its monopoly right by
      requesting that all diagnostic testing be done at its laboratory in the United
      States, has evoked strong reactions in Europe. Several opposition procedures have
      been started against these patents. After oral hearings at the EPO in Munich in
      May 2004, the first patent was revoked due to errors contained in the initially
      filed sequence. At oral proceedings in January 2005, the other two patents were
      severely limited in scope. The discussion on inventive step on the cloning of the
      BRCA1 gene - other than the one that relates to the priority date - has not taken
      place. In other words, the EPO has not questioned the patentability of this gene 
      per se. The author participated in the hearings in Munich and would like to give 
      the genetic community a firsthand account of the case.

TI  - Role of BRCA gene dysfunction in breast and ovarian cancer predisposition.
PG  - 324-30
AB  - Tumor suppressor genes that perform apparently generic cellular functions
      nonetheless cause tissue-specific syndromes in the human population when they are
      mutated in the germline. The two major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer
      predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, appear to participate in a common pathway 
      that is involved in the control of homologous recombination and in the
      maintenance of genomic integrity. How might such functions translate into the
      specific suppression of cancers of the breast and ovarian epithelia? Recent
      advances in the study of BRCA1 and BRCA2, discussed herein, have provided new
      opportunities to address this question.

TI  - Breast conservation therapy for invasive breast cancer in Ashkenazi women with
      BRCA gene founder mutations.
PG  - 2112-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with
      an increased risk of breast cancer. Whether women with breast cancer who have
      inherited mutations in these genes have a different outcome after breast
      conservation therapy than women with "sporadic" cancer is unresolved.
      Consequently, we compared the outcomes after breast conservation therapy in
      Ashkenazi women with or without germline mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2
      (hereafter called BRCA). METHODS: We studied 305 women of Ashkenazi Jewish
      descent undergoing breast-conserving treatment for 329 invasive breast cancers.
      We reviewed their clinical records, retrieved their archival tissue samples, and 
      tested those samples for the founder mutations BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC,
      and BRCA2 6174delT. Genetic results were linked to clinical data and outcomes by 
      univariate and multivariate analyses. All Pvalues are two-sided. RESULTS: We
      detected mutations in BRCA genes in 28 of 305 women. Women with BRCA mutations
      were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50 years (P<.001) 
      and to have lymph node involvement (P =.04). Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence 
      was more common in women with BRCA mutations, although this did not reach
      statistical significance (relative risk [RR] = 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]
      = 0.64-5.03). Women with mutations were more likely to develop contralateral
      breast cancer (RR = 3.50; 95% CI = 1.78-8.74; P =.001). Distant disease-free
      survival was shorter in women with mutations (66.2% versus 84.3% at 10 years; P
      =.05), as was breast cancer-specific survival (71.9% versus 87.2% at 10 years; P 
      =.02). Tumor stage and nodal status, but not mutation status, were predictive of 
      distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival in multivariate
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Women with BRCA founder mutations are at increased risk
      for breast cancer-related events after breast conservation. However, mutation
      status is not an independent predictor of survival and should not influence
      decisions regarding adjuvant therapy. The increased contralateral breast cancer
      risk in women heterozygous for BRCA mutations mandates careful surveillance.

PG  - 607-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The availability of a commercial test for the breast cancer
      susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, has generated interest in both the medical
      community and the general public. METHODS: Patients and family members were
      approached in the waiting room and asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire
      about their awareness of breast cancer genes and breast cancer gene testing, and 
      their desire to be tested. chi2 analysis was used to analyze frequencies between 
      groups. RESULTS: A total of 354 women completed a questionnaire concerning the
      breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The very young, the very old, and
      African-Americans were the least informed in terms of awareness of the genes and 
      the availability of testing for the breast cancer susceptibility genes. Jewish
      people, people with a college education or beyond, people earning more than
      $30,000 a year, and Caucasians were more aware of the genes and of testing for
      these genes. Interest in being tested was similar in all groups, except for
      participants over 60 and those who had only an elementary-school education.
      CONCLUSIONS: Information concerning the breast cancer susceptibility genes has
      not reached the general public uniformly. A concerted effort is needed if this
      information is to be passed on to those people at risk.
