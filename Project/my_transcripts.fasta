We identified a novel plant rhabdovirus infecting native joá (Solanum
aculeatissimum) plants in Brazil. Infected plants showed yellow blotches on the
leaves, and typical enveloped bacilliform rhabdovirus particles associated with
the nucleus were seen in thin sections by electron microscopy. The virus could be
graft-transmitted to healthy joá and tomato plants but was not mechanically
transmissible. RT-PCR using degenerate plant rhabdovirus L gene primers yielded
an amplicon from extracted total RNA, the sequence of which was similar to those 
of alphanucleorhabdoviruses. Based on close sequence matches, especially with the
type member potato yellow dwarf virus (PYDV), we adopted a
degenerate-primer-walking strategy towards both genome ends. The complete genome 
of joá yellow blotch-associated virus (JYBaV) is comprised of 12,965 nucleotides,
is less than 75% identical to that of its closest relative PYDV, and clusters
with PYDV and other alphanucleorhabdoviruses in L protein phylogenetic trees,
suggesting that it should be taxonomically classified in a new species in the
genus Alphanucleorhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae. The genome organization of
JYBaV is typical of the 'PYDV-like' subgroup of alphanucleorhabdoviruses, with
seven genes (N-X-P-Y-M-G-L) separated by conserved intergenic regions and flanked
by partly complementary 3' leader and 5' trailer regions.

The role of the nuclear protein coilin in the mechanisms of resistance of potato 
Solanum tuberosum cultivar Chicago to biotic and abiotic stresses was studied
using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. For the coilin gene editing, a complex
consisting of the Cas9 endonuclease and a short guide RNA was immobilized on gold
or chitosan microparticles and delivered into apical meristem cells by
bioballistics or vacuum infiltration methods, respectively. Editing at least one 
allele of the coilin gene considerably increased the resistance of the edited
lines to infection with the potato virus Y and their tolerance to salt and
osmotic stress.

This chapter reviews the discoveries and initial characterizations (1930-1990) of
three plant rhabdoviruses, sonchus yellow net virus, potato yellow dwarf virus,
and lettuce necrotic yellows virus, that have become model systems for research
on this group of enveloped negative-strand RNA plant viruses. We have used our
personal perspectives to review the early historical studies of these viruses,
the important technologies and tools, such as density gradient centrifugation,
that were developed during the research, and to highlight the eminent scientists 
involved in these discoveries. Early studies on sites of virus replication,
virion structure, physicochemical composition, and the use of protoplasts and
vector insect cell culture for virus research are discussed, and differences
between the nuclear and cytoplasmic lifestyles of plant rhabdoviruses are
contrasted. Finally, we briefly summarize the genome organization and more recent
developments culminating in the development of a reverse genetics system for
plant negative-strand RNA viruses.

The ability of the matrix (M) protein of potato yellow dwarf virus (PYDV) to
remodel nuclear membranes is controlled by a di-leucine motif located at residues
223 and 224 of its primary structure. This function can be uncoupled from that of
its nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is controlled primarily by lysine
and arginine residues immediately downstream of the LL motif. In planta
localization of green fluorescent protein fusions, bimolecular fluorescence
complementation assays with nuclear import receptor importin-a1 and yeast-based
nuclear import assays provided three independent experimental approaches to
validate the authenticity of the M-NLS. The carboxy terminus of M is predicted to
contain a nuclear export signal, which is belived to be functional, given the
ability of M to bind the Arabidopsis nuclear export receptor 1 (XPO1). The
nuclear shuttle activity of M has implications for the cell-to-cell movement of
PYDV nucleocapsids, based upon its interaction with the N and Y proteins.

The genome sequence of the constricta strain of Potato yellow dwarf virus (CYDV) 
was determined to be 12 792 nt long and organized into seven ORFs with the gene
order 3'-N-X-P-Y-M-G-L-5', which encodes the nucleocapsid, phospho, movement,
matrix, glyco, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins, respectively, except
for X, which is of unknown function. Cloned ORFs for each gene, except L, were
used to construct a protein interaction and localization map (PILM) for this
virus, which shares greater than 80 % amino acid similarity in all ORFs except X 
and P with the sanguinolenta strain of this species (SYDV). Protein localization 
patterns and interactions unique to each viral strain were identified, resulting 
in strain-specific PILMs. Localization of CYDV and SYDV proteins in
virus-infected cells mapped subcellular loci likely to be sites of replication,
morphogenesis and movement.

Thessaloniki, 54 124 Thessaloniki, Greece.

A novel strategy employing the rhabdovirus untranslated conserved intergenic
regions was developed and applied successfully for the determination of the
complete nucleotide sequence of Eggplant mottled dwarf virus (EMDV). The EMDV
genome contains seven open reading frames with the same organization as Potato
yellow dwarf virus (PYDV), the type species of the genus Nucleorhabdovirus. These
two species encode five core genes [nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix 
(M), glycoprotein (G), and the polymerase (L)] like other viruses of the genus
and an additional one (X), located between N and P, giving rise to a protein with
currently unknown function. Furthermore, both EMDV and PYDV contain a gene (Y),
inserted between P and M, which probably encodes the virus movement protein, in
concordance with the rest of the plant-infecting rhabdoviruses. Phylogenetic
analysis of the polymerase gene confirmed the classification of EMDV within the
genus Nucleorhabdovirus and showed a close evolutionary relationship to PYDV. The
novel sequencing strategy developed is a useful tool for the genome determination
of yet uncharacterized rhabdoviruses.

The Nucleocapsid Protein of Potato Yellow dwarf Virus: Protein Interactions and
Nuclear Import Mediated by a Non-Canonical Nuclear Localization Signal.

Potato yellow dwarf virus (PYDV) is the type species of the genus
Nucleorhabdovirus and, like all members of this genus, replication and
morphogenesis occurs inside the nuclei of infected cells. Protein localization
prediction algorithms failed to identify a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in
PYDV nucleocapsid (N) protein, although PYDV-N has been shown to localize
exclusively to the nucleus when expressed as a green fluorescent protein (GFP):N 
fusion in plant cells. Deletion analysis using fragments of PYDV-N identified a
karyophilic region in the carboxy-terminal 122 amino acids. Alanine-scanning
mutagenesis was performed across this region in the context of the full-length N 
protein. Mutants were assayed for their ability to nuclear localize using
live-cell imaging and a yeast-based assay. Two amino acid motifs, (419)QKR(421)
and (432)KR(433) were shown to be essential for nuclear import and interaction
with importin-a. Additional bimolecular fluorescence complementation showed that 
the PYDV-N-NLS mutants cannot be ferried into the nucleus via interaction with
PYDV-P or -M. In contrast, interaction with N-NLS mutants appeared to retard the 
nuclear import of PYDV-P. GFP fused to aa 419-434 established that the PYDV-N-NLS
can function outside the context of this protein. Taken together, it was
determined that PYDV-N contains the bipartite NLS (419)QKRANEEAPPAAQKR(433).

Lettuce necrotic yellows virus (LNYV), Sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV) and Potato
yellow dwarf virus (PYDV) are members of the family Rhabdoviridae that infect
plants. LNYV is a cytorhabdovirus that replicates in the cytoplasm, while SYNV
and PYDV are nucleorhabdoviruses that replicate in the nuclei of infected cells. 
LNYV and SYNV share a similar genome organization with a gene order of
nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), putative movement protein (Mv), matrix
protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). PYDV contains an additional
predicted gene of unknown function located between N and P. In order to gain
insight into the associations of viral structural and non-structural proteins and
the mechanisms by which they may function, we constructed protein localization
and interaction maps. Subcellular localization was determined by transiently
expressing the viral proteins fused to green or red fluorescent protein in leaf
epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. Protein interactions were tested in
planta by using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. All three viruses
showed Mv to be localized at the cell periphery and the G protein to be membrane 
associated. Comparing the interaction maps revealed that only the N-P and M-M
interactions are common to all three viruses. Associations unique to only one
virus include P-M for LNYV, G-Mv for SYNV and M-Mv, M-G and N-M for PYDV. The
cognate N-P proteins of all three viruses interacted and exhibited characteristic
changes in localization when co-expressed.

The genome of Potato yellow dwarf virus (PYDV; Nucleorhabdovirus type species)
was determined to be 12,875 nucleotides (nt). The antigenome is organized into
seven open reading frames (ORFs) ordered 3'-N-X-P-Y-M-G-L-5', which likely encode
the nucleocapsid, phospho, movement, matrix, glyco and RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase proteins, respectively, except for X, which is of unknown function.
The ORFs are flanked by a 3' leader RNA of 149 nt and a 5' trailer RNA of 97 nt, 
and are separated by conserved intergenic junctions. Phylogenetic analyses
indicated that PYDV is closely related to other leafhopper-transmitted
rhabdoviruses. Functional protein assays were used to determine the subcellular
localization of PYDV proteins. Surprisingly, the M protein was able to induce the
intranuclear accumulation of the inner nuclear membrane in the absence of any
other viral protein. Finally, bimolecular fluorescence complementation was used
to generate the most comprehensive protein interaction map for a plant-adapted
rhabdovirus to date.

Cloning and subcellular localization of the phosphoprotein and nucleocapsid
proteins of Potato yellow dwarf virus, type species of the genus

We have cloned and characterized mRNAs corresponding to the phosphoprotein (P)
and nucleocapsid (N) genes of the sanguinolenta strain of Potato yellow dwarf
virus (PYDV). The P and N messenger RNAs both begin with a common AAACA
pentanucleotide and are 1546nt and 962nt in length, and capable of encoding 52kDa
and 31kDa proteins, respectively. The N mRNA contains a 12nt 5' non-translated
sequence (NTS) and a 83nt 3'-NTS. Similarly, the P mRNA has a 19nt 5'-NTS and a
125nt 3'-NTS. Primary structure analyses revealed three potential phosphorylation
sites in the P protein and six in the N protein. Despite a lack of predictable
nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in either protein, transient expression of
the P and N proteins in N. benthamiana showed that both proteins are targeted
exclusively to nuclei. Phylogenetic analyses showed that PYDV is most closely
related to Maize mosaic virus and Taro vein chlorosis virus, which also lack
predictable NLSs in their N proteins. The present data further distinguish PYDV
from SYNV and suggest that, together, these viruses serve to provide a more
comprehensive view of rhabdovirus cell biology, which can be studied in a common 
host plant.

Potato yellow dwarf virus (PYDV) and Sonchus yellow net virus (SYNV) belong to
the genus Nucleorhabdovirus. These viruses replicate in nuclei of infected cells 
and mature virions accumulate in the perinuclear space after budding through the 
inner nuclear membrane. Infection of transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana 16c plants 
(which constitutively express green fluorescent protein (GFP) targeted to
endomembranes) with PYDV or SYNV resulted in virus-specific patterns of
accumulation of both GFP and membranes within nuclei. Using immunolocalization
and a lipophilic fluorescent dye, we show that the sites of the relocalized
membranes were coincident with foci of accumulation of the SYNV nucleocapsid
protein. In contrast to the effects of PYDV and SYNV, inoculation of 16c plants
with plus-strand RNA viruses did not result in accumulation of intranuclear GFP. 
Instead, such infections resulted in accumulation of GFP around nuclei, in a
manner consistent with proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose
that the relocalization of GFP in 16c plants can be used to study sites of
rhabdovirus accumulation in live cells. This study is the first to use live-cell 
imaging to characterize the effects of rhabdoviruses on plant nuclear membranes.
