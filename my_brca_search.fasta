BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to explore the value of
two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) radiomics models based on
enhanced computed tomography (CT) images in predicting BRCA gene mutations in
patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 106 patients with ovarian cancer
confirmed by surgery and pathology were retrospectively analyzed and genetic
testing was performed. Radiomics features extracted from the 2D and 3D regions of
interest of the patients' primary tumor lesions were selected in the training set
using the maximum correlation and minimum redundancy method. Then, the best
features were selected through Lasso tenfold cross-validation. Feature subsets
were employed to establish a radiomics model. The model's performance was
evaluated via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and
its clinical validity was assessed by using the model's decision curve.
RESULTS: On the validation set, the area under the curve values of the 2D, 3D,
and 2D + 3D combined models were 0.78 (0.61-0.96), 0.75 (0.55-0.92), and 0.82
(0.61-0.96), respectively. However, the DeLong test P values between the three
pairs of models were all > 0.05. The decision curve analysis showed that the
radiomics model had a high net benefit across all high-risk threshold
probabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The three radiomics models can predict the BRCA gene mutation in
ovarian cancer, and there were no statistically significant differences between
the prediction performance of the three models.

BACKGROUND: Gynecologic oncologists should be aware of the option of conception
through IVF/PGT-M for families with high BRCA related morbidity or mortality. Our
objective was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of preimplantation genetic
testing for selection and transfer of BRCA negative embryo in BRCA mutation
carriers compared to natural conception.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of two strategies, conception through IVF/PGT-M and
BRCA negative embryo transfer versus natural conception with a 50% chance of BRCA
positive newborn for BRCA mutation carriers was compared using a Markovian
process decision analysis model. Costs of the two strategies were compared using 
quality adjusted life years (QALYs'). All costs were discounted at 3%.
Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to willingness to pay
threshold was used for cost-effectiveness analysis.
RESULTS: IVF/ PGT-M is cost-effective with an ICER of 150,219 new Israeli
Shekels, per QALY gained (equivalent to 44,480 USD), at a 3% discount rate.
CONCLUSIONS: IVF/ PGT-M and BRCA negative embryo transfer compared to natural
conception among BRCA positive parents is cost effective and may be offered for
selected couples with high BRCA mutation related morbidity or mortality. Our
results could impact decisions regarding conception among BRCA positive couples
and health care providers.

BACKGROUND: This commentary explores and discusses the challenges oncologists
face in diagnosing and managing breast cancer patients with BRCA gene mutations
in Lebanon and the Middle East.
METHODS: Key opinion leaders shared their recommendations to achieve better
patient outcomes and satisfaction based on evidence-based medicine and their
clinical experience in BRCA management.
RESULTS: Challenges associated with BRCA management can be divided into four main
levels: physicians, patients, test, and treatment factors. More genetic
counselors are to be identified given their important role in the management of
individuals with BRCA gene mutations.
CONCLUSION: Genetic counseling, continuing education, infrastructure, testing,
expertise, and financial support are needed to fulfill the unmet needs in the
management of BRCA mutation carriers.

To identify approaches to target DNA repair vulnerabilities in cancer, we
discovered nanomolar potent, selective, low molecular weight (MW), allosteric
inhibitors of the polymerase function of DNA polymerase Pol<U+03B8>, including ART558.
ART558 inhibits the major Pol<U+03B8>-mediated DNA repair process, Theta-Mediated End
Joining, without targeting Non-Homologous End Joining. In addition, ART558
elicits DNA damage and synthetic lethality in BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant tumour cells
and enhances the effects of a PARP inhibitor. Genetic perturbation screening
revealed that defects in the 53BP1/Shieldin complex, which cause PARP inhibitor
resistance, result in in vitro and in vivo sensitivity to small molecule Pol<U+03B8>
polymerase inhibitors. Mechanistically, ART558 increases biomarkers of
single-stranded DNA and synthetic lethality in 53BP1-defective cells whilst the
inhibition of DNA nucleases that promote end-resection reversed these effects,
implicating these in the synthetic lethal mechanism-of-action. Taken together,
these observations describe a drug class that elicits BRCA-gene synthetic
lethality and PARP inhibitor synergy, as well as targeting a biomarker-defined
mechanism of PARPi-resistance.

Reconstructive breast surgery after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy in patients
who carry a mutation of the breast cancer (BRCA) gene has been increasing.
Undergoing risk-reducing breast surgery can be of great benefit to young patients
who have a high risk of developing breast cancer. There is little available
evidence about the rate of complications in these patients and which factors are 
related to increased complications. The objective of this study was to identify
predictors of complications in BRCA gene mutation carriers who underwent
reconstructive breast surgery. A single-center, retrospective cohort study was
conducted that included all patients with a mutation of the BRCA gene who
underwent a breast reconstructive procedure, either immediate or delayed, between
January 2013 and March 2019 and received a minimum of 6 months' follow-up. The
results of our study showed that smoking is the most important modifiable risk
factor associated with an increased complication rate for reconstructive breast
surgery in patients with BRCA gene mutation. Smoking cessation will reduce the
patient's risk for postoperative complications by 50%; therefore, it should be
encouraged in all surgical patients and enforced in patients undergoing
prophylactic procedures.

Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK.

The objective of this study was to compare the pick-up rate of pathogenic BRCA
variants in those with a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) undergoing
oncology-led testing with the traditional genetics family history-based testing
model. With novel therapies, BRCA status can affect treatment. Welsh oncologists 
are now testing all women with HGSOC at diagnosis rather than referring to
genetics, where family history is required for testing. The records of 332 women 
who underwent testing via oncology were analysed. The outcome measures were;
percentage of women with a pathogenic BRCA variant and the difference in
identification of pathogenic BRCA variants between the oncology-led and
traditional genetics testing models. Of the 332 women, 25 women (7.5%) tested
positive for a pathogenic BRCA variant. This was slightly lower than the
detection rate of 9.8% for patients tested via the genetics service over the same
period. Testing through genetics, using family history criteria would have
identified only 19 (76%) of those with pathogenic variants in the oncology
cohort. Since women with a pathogenic BRCA variant can be offered life-extending 
targeted treatment and a significant proportion of these women would be missed if
testing was offered based on family history criteria alone, universal BRCA
testing of all women with HGSOC is justified.Impact statement:What is already
known on this subject? It is well established that individuals with a strong
family history of breast and ovarian cancer are more likely to carry a pathogenic
BRCA gene variant. With the use of tools such as the Manchester scoring system
women are often invited for testing through clinical genetics services. Until
recently there was no clinical impact for those already diagnosed with ovarian
cancer.What do the results of this study add? Our study has shown that the
diagnosis of high grade serious ovarian carcinoma alone without the need for any 
family history leads to a similar rate of detection of pathogenic BRCA variants
as traditional methods. With the advent of targeted treatments such as olaparib, 
women with a pathogenic BRCA variant can access different life extending
treatment options. With comparable pick-up rates to traditional family history
based scoring systems, oncologists can now arrange BRCA gene testing
directly.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or
further research? Our study shows universal genetic testing of those with
high-grade serious ovarian carcinoma by oncologists allows more women to access
life extending treatment in a shorter timeframe compared to the traditional
testing model used by clinical genetics services. We hope that other centres,
both in the UK and beyond, will adopt this approach.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
patients with BRCA gene mutation have enhanced sensitivity to platinum-based
regimens and PARP inhibitors. However, the knowledge regarding BRCA mutation in
Thai patients is limited. This study aimed at identifying the prevalence and
characteristics of somatic and germline BRCA 1 and 2 mutations in Thai patients
with these cancers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The paraffin blocks of tumors with histology of high grade
serous, high grade endometrioid, or clear cell carcinoma obtained between June
2016 and December 2017 were analyzedto evaluate BRCA mutation using
next-generation sequencing system. Blood or normal tissue paraffin blocks of
positive patients were further tested for germline BRCA mutation.
RESULTS: Tissue paraffin blocks of 178 patients were collected but only 139 were 
analyzed. Positive BRCA mutation was identified in 24 patients (17.3%): BRCA1 in 
13 cases, BRCA2 in 10 cases, and BRCA1 and 2 in the rest one. Germline mutation
study in blood or normal tissue in 23 positive patients revealed BRCA mutation in
14 cases, BRCA1 in 8 cases and BRCA 2  in 6 cases. Overall, the prevalence of
somatic and germline mutation was 6.5% (9 out of 138 patients) and 8.7% (14 out
of 138 patients), respectively. The most common histology associated with BRCA
mutation was high grade serous cancer (27.3%). No significant difference was
found between patients with or without BRCA mutation in terms of stage, outcome, 
platinum status, and survival outcome.
CONCLUSION: BRCA mutation was demonstrated in less than 10% of Thai ovarian
cancer patients. Higher rate of mutation was found in high grade serous
cancer.<br />.

The discovery of cancer-causing BRCA1/2 mutations and the emergence of genetic
testing have brought precision in patient selection for poly-(ADP)-ribose
polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) treatment. Interestingly, patients who are carriers 
of BRCA1/2 mutations have a higher risk for developing cancer, but respond better
to DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy, such as platinum-based chemotherapy. The
distinctive biology of ovarian cancer involves high genomic instability
consisting of gene amplification, gene deletion, oncogene hypomethylation, loss
of heterozygosity, and tumor suppressor gene promoter hypermethylation in many of
the DNA damage response (DDR) genes, including BRCA1/2. Several of these genetic 
abnormalities can impair high fidelity DNA damage repair increasing the
therapeutic audience for PARPi's. This is especially important given the clinical
development over the last decade of this group of agents and the dramatic
increase in progression free survival among ovarian cancer patients who received 
PARPi, both in treatment or maintenance setting. In this review, we summarize our
current understanding of the role of BRCA1/2 mutations in ovarian cancer and
present relevant clinical trials in which BRCA1/2 was investigated as biomarker
for therapy. We also outline the role of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency
as biomarker by presenting the recent clinical development and recent approvals
PARPi for firstline maintenance in ovarian cancer.

BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene mutations as an emerging biomarker for the treatment of
gastrointestinal malignancies.

BReast CAncer (BRCA) genes 1 and 2 were discovered in the 1990's by Hall et al.
and Wooster et al. respectively. BRCA genes have been shown to be associated with
an increased risk of various gastrointestinal (GI) cancers beyond known risk of
breast, ovary and prostate cancers. Studies have demonstrated the role of BRCA
genes in the DNA repair pathway and modalities to exploit this pathway are being 
currently explored. Using the concept of synthetic lethality, poly-ADP ribose
polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have significant activity in BRCA deficient cells. 
Targeted therapy is gaining popularity worldwide and BRCA genes have received
much attention since the development and approval of PARPis. Multiple studies
have also identified the predictive value of BRCA genes related to platinum and
other DNA-damaging cytotoxic agents. BRCA deficient cells are about 5-fold more
sensitive to platinum-based agents and almost 1,000-fold more with PARPis.
Genomic instability has been established as the hallmark of BRCA deficient tumors
and the specific roles of BRCA genes in DNA damage repair is increasingly clear. 
Herein, we discuss the risks and incidence of individual GI cancers seen with
BRCA mutations, highlight tumor biology and provide a comprehensive review of the
available preclinical and clinical data and upcoming trials related to this
topic. The "POLO" trial in metastatic pancreas cancer establishes a "proof of
principle" regarding treatment of BRCA-related cancer and PARPi. In pancreatic
cancer routine germline genetic testing is now recommended in most major
guidelines. Newer studies are emerging, which will expand the concept of BRCAness
and ways to effectively detect this phenotype in GI cancers and impact clinical
practice.

BACKGROUND: The University of Alabama at Birmingham Preventative Care Program for
Women's Cancer provides genetic testing, risk evaluation, and screening for
breast cancer. Women diagnosed with high-risk mutations may opt to undergo active
surveillance or prophylactic surgery. This decision requires understanding of the
surveillance process and its potential outcomes. In this study, we report
specifically on women with non-BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted of women enrolled
in our program identified as high risk because of non-BRCA mutations. Events
regarding genetic mutations, method of detection of suspicious lesions, number of
biopsies, results of those biopsies, prophylactic surgery, and cancer diagnosis
were collected.
RESULTS: We identified 78 patients with asymptomatic non-BRCA deleterious
mutations. Sixteen mutations were identified, with the most common being ATM,
CHEK2, and PALB2. In total, 11.5% underwent prophylactic surgery and 88.5%
underwent active surveillance. In the surveillance group, 63.8% had no
examination or imaging to warrant biopsy, 24.6% had biopsy with benign result,
and 11.6% had biopsy with malignant result. For the nine women who developed
breast cancer during surveillance, six were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in
situ, two with stage I, and one with stage IIA cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with non-BRCA mutations enroll in prevention clinics with
hopes of early detection of breast cancer. Because of increased screening, this
population undergoes biopsy more frequently; however, during surveillance most do
not require a biopsy. For those that do, the result is typically benign. This
information can further allow women to make informed decisions about surveillance
and establish realistic expectations regarding the likelihood of tissue sampling.

INTRODUCTION: Risk-reducing-salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) inevitably leads BRCA
mutation carriers to premature menopause.
AREAS COVERED: To evaluate the existing evidence for use of postmenopausal
hormone therapy (HT) in BRCAmc, after RRSO or menopause occurring naturally, for 
both breast cancer (BC) survivors and those without BC.
EXPERT OPINION: All BC survivors are excluded from any HT treatment: in other
BRCAmc, before 51 years of age the benefits of HT overcome the risks after RRSO
and/or premature ovarian insufficiency (POF). After 51 years of age, it is
important to treat only women with important vasomotor symptoms, after the
failure of alternative therapies. Estrogens-only therapy plays a key role in
hysterectomized women (HW). In the case of an intact uterus (UW), associations
with the lowest dose of progestins/natural progesterone derivatives have to be
preferred, as progestins has been shown to play an important role in BC
transformation, especially in BRCA1mc. No studies have been performed in BRCAmc
with regard to 'progestin-free' HT, in particular the old tibolone (both in HW
and UW) and the new tissue-selective estrogen complex (in UW). However,
preliminary data obtained from the general population are reassuring about the
use of these 'progestin-free' preparations and BC safety.

Mutation of BRCA genes significantly increases the lifetime risk of breast,
ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers. In addition to the
increased risk of these multiple malignancies, the recent literature suggests
that mutations in BRCA genes may lead to decreased reproductive potential. In
this systematic review, we focus on the effect of BRCA gene mutation on
reproductive potential. The main outcomes included the rate of nulliparity,
ovarian reserve, ovarian response, and the age at natural menopause. A total of
23 observational studies were included for quality analysis. The certainty of
evidence was low to moderate: the main limitations were imprecision and
statistically significant heterogeneity. Meta-analysis suggested that the rate of
nulliparity, serum anti-müllerian hormone levels, antral follicle counts and
ovarian response were not significantly affected in BRCA gene mutation carriers
(P > 0.05). BRCA gene mutation carriers tended to have a lower number of
primordial follicles (P = 0.0002) and lower age at natural menopause than
non-carriers. In conclusion, there is no compelling evidence indicating that the 
rate of nulliparity, serum AMH, antral follicle counts and ovarian response are
affected in BRCA mutation carriers.

BACKGROUND: For the past decades, number of prophylactic bilateral mastectomies
using reconstruction with implants increases. We describe a new surgical strategy
and analyse its safety and feasability.
METHOD: It is a retrospective, descriptive and monocentric study. The first step 
of surgery consisted in obteining a peri-prosthetic capsule with implants and if 
there was a mammary hypertrophy and/or ptosis, it was corrected at the same time.
The second step of surgery was the nipple-sparing mastectomy with change of
implants for bigger ones. Third step consisted in a lipofilling.
RESULTS: Seven patients were included. 6 women had a BRCA1 gene mutation. Mean
age was 35.6 year-old [29.6; 41.6], mean BMI was 23.8kg/m2 [20.6; 27], mean chest
circumference was 93.7cm [87.4; 100], mean cup was C- [B-; D-]. 4 women had
mammary hypertrophy and/or ptosis. Mean number of procedure per woman was 3.6
[2.5; 4.7]. Mean volume of implants used at the first step was 248.6ml [211.3;
285.9]. The second step was performed mean 33.9 weeks [22.3; 45.5] later. Mean
increase of implants volume was 120ml [80.4; 159.6]. 4 patients had
complications including 1 who had implant exposure. Six patients had lipofilling 
of mean volume per breast of 175ml [116; 234].
CONCLUSION: This new strategy could decrease complication rate, improve aesthetic
outcome and decrease psychological impact of surgery.

testing.

Some 5-10% of all breast cancers are associated with a pathogenic variant in a
breast cancer-associated gene (BRCA1/BRCA2). Historically, with referral to the
Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust's clinical genetics department for
genetic testing, waiting times were on average 12-14 weeks for an initial
appointment and 4-6 months to obtain results from the date of testing. A
specialist, nurse-led mainstreaming cancer genetics (MCG) service was set up in
the trust's Nottingham Breast Institute (NBI) to: reduce waiting times for the
initial consultation, counselling, consent and obtaining results for BRCA1/BRCA2 
gene testing; and to ensure appropriate patients with breast cancer were offered 
genetic testing. Two breast clinical nurse specialists were trained so they could
counsel, consent and give results for the BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing directly to
patients. Average waiting times for results from the time of testing were reduced
to 35.8 days under the nurse-led service, which enabled oncologists and patients 
to consider individual treatment options at an earlier time. The MCG service
reduced waiting times, resulting in an improved, more streamlined service for
patients undergoing genetic testing. The MCG service extended the scope of
practice of the breast nurse clinical specialists, embedded an expert advanced
nursing role in the breast multidisciplinary team and developed nurse mentoring
opportunities.

In this era of personalisation a patient's molecular profile plays an
increasingly central role in development and delivery of personalised medicine.
This paper sets out to explore the sociocultural implications of mainstreaming
BRCA genetic testing in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer patients, who
carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. It draws on ethnographic research conducted
by between April-June 2016 in a large tertiary London hospital. Participant
observation was conducted across two sites. For the first two weeks participant
observation was conducted in the traditional genetic testing setting in two
separate clinics. From thereon, participant observation was conducted in the
clinical encounters of treating patients in the ovarian cancer clinic. In
addition, face-to-face interviews were conducted with medical oncologists who
worked in the clinic. Contributing to the fields of cancer genetics, personalised
medicine and medical material culture studies in medical anthropology the paper
seeks to further discussions about the interactions and relationships unfolding
between medical objects and subjects across the landscape of cancer care. It
highlights the importance of clinic-based ethnography to examine the complexities
of identities and technologies as they intersect with the themes of suffering and
hope in new and contradictory ways for BRCA-positive patients with late-stage
disease. The paper argues that a BRCA mutation is not only central to the
political economy of hope but takes on a more materialist nature as it becomes an
embodied practice that moves in and beyond the clinic.

This study investigated the prevalence of TIL subpopulations, TLS, PD-1 and PD-L1
in tumors from TNBC patients harboring wild-type or mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2
germline genes. This TNBC cohort included 85% TIL-positive (=10%) tumors with 21%
classified as TILhi (=50%). Interestingly, the BRCAmut group had a significantly 
higher incidence of TILpos tumors compared to the BRCAwt group (P = 0.037). T
cells were dominant in the infiltrate but no statistically significant
differences were detected between BRCAwt and BRCAmut for CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells or CD20+ B cells. TLS were detected in 74% of tumors but again no
significant differences between the BRCA groups. PD-1 expression was observed in 
33% and PD-L1 in 53% (any cell, cut-off =1%) tumors for the entire TNBC cohort.
PD-1 expression correlated with PD-L1 and both with TIL and TLS but was not
associated with BRCA mutational status. Our analyses reveal that BRCAwt and
BRCAmut TNBC are similar except for a significant increase of TILpos tumors in
the BRCAmut group. While BRCA gene mutations may not directly drive immune
infiltration, the greater number of TILpos tumors could signal greater
immunogenicity in this group.

AIMS: To determine the proportion of eligible patients with high-grade serous
carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum discussed at gynaecological 
oncology multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs) in New Zealand and subsequently
referred for genetic counselling and BRCA pathogenic variant testing.
METHODS: Eligible cases were identified from Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch
and Dunedin gynaecologic oncology MDM databases between 1 January 2015 to 31
December 2016. Patients who met the eligibility criteria for genetics referral
were identified, and cross-referenced against genetic services databases to
ascertain the rates of referrals received, the numbers attending appointments,
genetic testing offered and range of results.
RESULTS: During the two-year period, 205 patients were eligible for referral. Of 
these, 143 (70%) patients were referred for genetic counselling with 128 (90%) of
this group recommended for BRCA pathogenic variant testing. Of the 126 who
undertook the test, results were available for 120 (95%). Nineteen patients (16%)
tested positive for a germline BRCA pathogenic variant.
CONCLUSIONS: The New Zealand rate of referral to genetic counselling for women
with high-grade serous cancer, (HGSC), of the ovary, fallopian tube or peritoneum
diagnosed between 2015-2016 is encouraging when compared with others
internationally. The rate of BRCA positive pathogenic variants is comparable to
international data.

OBJECTIVE: High background parenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular
tissue on breast magnetic resonance imaging are related to increased breast
cancer risk. This study sought to compare these parameters between BRCA mutation 
carriers and non-carriers and to evaluate the potential implications of the
findings for short term follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging studies of known BRCA mutation 
carriers, were compared to age-matched non-carrier studies performed in the same 
center during the same period. The groups were compared for qualitative
background parenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular tissue using the 
Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).
RESULTS: Breast parenchymal enhancement was high in up to one-third of the
cohort: 22% of carriers and 33% of controls (p = 0.013). These results were
sustained on separate analysis of menstrual-cycle-timed examinations. Amount of
fibroglandular tissue was high in most cases: 62% of carriers and 75% of controls
(p = 0.004). A BI-RADS final assessment score of 3 was more common in patients
with high parenchymal enhancement, especially controls.
CONCLUSION: BRCA mutation carriers demonstrated lower levels of breast
parenchymal enhancement and amount of fibroglandular tissue than age-matched
non-carriers. These differences are probably influenced by hormonal status, as
well as highlight different risks in distinctive subgroups of breast cancer
(hormone-enriched, mutation-associated defective DNA damage repair), affecting
considerations of preventive medical treatment. Differences in the indications
for imaging between the carrier and non-carrier groups (screening for mutations
and breast cancer evaluation, respectively) probably accounted for the higher
rate of BI-RADS 3 in the control group.

Men with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations are at increased risk of developing breast
cancer and may have an indication for breast cancer screening using mammography. 
Since breast cancer is often viewed as a woman's disease, visibilizing and
understanding men's experience of having a BRCA mutation and specifically, of
screening for breast cancer through mammography, were the objectives of this
research study. The theoretical framework of interpretive phenomenology guided
the process of data collection, coding, and analysis. Phenomenology is both a
philosophy and research method which focuses on understanding the nature of
experience from the perspectives of people experiencing a phenomenon, the essence
of and commonalities among people's experiences, and the ways in which people
experience the world through their bodies. Data were collected via in-depth
interviews with a purposive sample of 15 male participants recruited from the
Male Oncology Research and Education (MORE) Program. This article reports
findings about participants' use of gender-specific language to describe their
breasts, awareness of the ways in which their bodies changed overtime, and
experiences of undergoing mammograms. This study is the first to describe men
with BRCA's perceptions of their breasts and experiences of mammography in a
high-risk cancer screening clinic. This study sheds light on an under-researched 
area-breasts and masculinities-and could potentially lead to improved clinical
understanding of men's embodied experiences of BRCA, as well as suggestions for
improving the delivery of male breast cancer screening services.

Women who inherit a mutated copy of the BRCA gene have a higher lifetime risk of 
developing breast cancer. No large epidemiological studies exist looking at BRCA 
mutation carriers in UK populations. All patients with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation
identified between 1995 and 2015 were included. Individuals were identified from 
a prospectively gathered data base. Genetics case-notes were obtained and
retrospective analysis performed. 581 female BRCA mutation carriers were
identified with a median age of 34 (18-81) at the time of testing. Of the 301
women who underwent diagnostic testing (symptomatic) 246 had been diagnosed with 
breast cancer, 89 with ovarian cancer and 37 had both at time of testing. Median 
age at diagnostic test was 51 (25-81). 33% of women underwent risk-reducing
mastectomies (RRM); median age at surgery 45. This compares with 37% of women in 
this diagnostic group who underwent Risk-reducing bilateral
salpingo-oopherectomies (RRBSO) at a median age of 46. Two hundred and eighty
women underwent predictive testing (family history, asymptomatic), median age 36 
(18-81). 34% of women in this predictive group underwent RRM, median age 37.
There was a 29% uptake of RRBSO (median age 44 years). Fifteen women (5%)
developed breast cancer after being tested; none of these had undergone RRS. This
unique study of all BRCA mutation carriers in Wales shows considerable variation 
in uptake of RRS. The decision to undergo RRS is complex and involves a number of
factors, including a woman's age and life stage. As BRCA testing becomes more
frequent and more gene mutation carriers are identified there will be significant
implications for service allocation, screening demands, and provision of
risk-reducing surgery for this high-risk patient group.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Treatment is chosen
according to its hormone receptor status and human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) status. Among the four main clinically set subtypes, hormone
receptor-negative/HER2-negative subtype, also called triple-negative subtype
(TNBC), is the most aggressive type with limited choices of therapy. However,
recent research has provided important new insights into effective treatments for
this subtype. One molecular target that has gained attention is the BRCA gene.
BRCA proteins are involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity, therefore
playing an important role as a "caretaker" DNA repair protein. Approximately 5%
of all breast cancer patients are BRCA mutation carriers, and among the patients 
with BRCA mutations, 57.1% have the clinical TNBC subtype, showing a high
association between BRCA mutations and TNBCs. When cells lack either BRCA1 or
BRCA2, all types of homology-directed repairs are compromised, and
poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase (PARP) acts as a backup system to maintain the 
genome, consequently making the cells highly sensitive to PARP1 inhibitors. PARP 
inhibitors have shown promising activity in preclinical and early clinical
trials, and today, phase III trials are ongoing. In this chapter, we discuss the 
mechanism and the role of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated breast cancers and
further elaborate the clinical potential of PARP inhibitors as well as their
barriers.

In breast cancer 1 (BRCA) gene mutation carriers, mastectomy is still the
mainstay of treatment for breast cancers due to the increased risk of local
recurrence. It is performed as a therapeutic, as well as prophylactic procedure. 
However, mastectomy with removal of nipple areolar complex (NAC) is associated
with adverse cosmetic outcome. NAC sparing mastectomy (NSM), which results in
better cosmetic outcome, has been performed in non-BRCA mutation carriers. While 
studies have shown that NSM is a oncologically safe in sporadic breast cancers,
its application in BRCA mutation carriers is still controversial. Here we review 
the existing evidence of NSM and its application in BRCA mutation carriers.

Global burden of breast cancer is expected to increase to >2 million new cases
every year by 2030 and 10% of these are likely to have hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer syndrome. Identifying these individuals by pedigree and BRCA1/2
mutation analyses will enable us to offer targeted mutation testing and
appropriate counseling. This study from a tertiary care hospital showed that of
the 127 breast cancer patients on treatment during 2014-2015, 24 of them
fulfilled the criteria of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome after
detailed verbal autopsy and pedigree analysis, and BRCA1 and 2 next-generation
sequencing done after pre-test counseling revealed mutations in 13 cases (54%),
these included 9 BRCA1 mutations (69%) and 4 BRCA2 mutation (31%). Subsequent
post-test counseling recommended targeted mutation analysis for 64 high-risk
members in these 13 families with pathogenic mutations, which will help in
surveillance for early detection, appropriate management, and prevention of the
disease by decreasing the burden to both family and nation. Results from this
preliminary study highlight the importance of genetic counseling, pedigree
analysis, and genetic testing. It can be recommended that all oncology units
should have a genetic counseling service for providing appropriate support to
oncologists, patients, and families to prevent unnecessary testing; however,
breast cancer screening program is incomplete without evaluating for hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

OBJECTIVE:  To examine the effect on BRCA testing and mastectomy rates of a
widely viewed 2013 New York Times editorial by public figure Angelina Jolie that 
endorsed BRCA testing and announced Jolie's decision to undergo preventive
mastectomy.
DESIGN:  Observational study with difference-in-difference analysis.
SETTING:  Commercially insured US population.
PARTICIPANTS:  Women aged 18-64 years with claims in the Truven MarketScan
commercial claims database (n=9 532 836).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Changes in BRCA testing rates in the 15 business days
before versus after 14 May 2013 (editorial date) compared with the change in the 
same period in 2012; mastectomy rates in the months before and after publication,
both overall and within 60 days of BRCA testing among women who were tested;
national estimates of incremental tests and expenditures associated with Jolie's 
article in the 15 days after publication.
RESULTS:  Daily BRCA test rates increased immediately after the 2013 editorial,
from 0.71 tests/100 000 women in the 15 business days before to 1.13
tests/100 000 women in the 15 business days after publication. In comparison,
daily test rates were similar in the same period in 2012 (0.58/100 000 women in
the 15 business days before 14 May versus 0.55/100 000 women in the 15 business
days after), implying a difference-in-difference absolute daily increase of 0.45 
tests/100 000 women or a 64% relative increase (P<0.001). The editorial was
associated with an estimated increase of 4500 BRCA tests and $13.5m (£10.8m;
12.8) expenditure nationally among commercially insured adult women in those 15 
days. Increased BRCA testing rates were sustained throughout 2013. Overall
mastectomy rates remained unchanged in the months after publication, but 60 day
mastectomy rates among women who had a BRCA test fell from 10% in the months
before publication to 7% in the months after publication, suggesting that women
who underwent tests as a result of to the editorial had a lower pre-test
probability of having the BRCA mutation than women tested before the editorial.
CONCLUSIONS:  Celebrity endorsements can have a large and immediate effect on use
of health services. Such announcements can be a low cost means of reaching a
broad audience quickly, but they may not effectively target the subpopulations
that are most at risk for the relevant underlying condition.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are implicated in 20-25% of hereditary breast and ovarian
cancers. New age sequencing platforms have revolutionized massively parallel
sequencing in clinical practice by providing cost effective, rapid, and sensitive
sequencing. This study critically evaluates the false positives in multiplex
panels and suggests the need for careful analysis. We employed multiplex PCR
based BRCA1 and BRCA2 community Panel with ion torrent PGM machine for evaluation
of these mutations. Out of all 41samples analyzed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 five were
found with 950_951 insA(Asn319fs) at Chr13:32906565 position and one sample with 
1032_1033 insA(Asn346fs) at Chr13:32906647, both being frame-shift mutations in
BRCA2 gene. 950_951 insA(Asn319fs) mutation is reported as pathogenic allele in
NCBI dbSNP. On examination of IGV for all these samples, it was seen that both
mutations had 'A' nucleotide insertion at 950, and 1032 position in exon 10 of
BRCA2 gene. Sanger Sequencing did not confirm these insertions. Next-generation
sequencing shows great promise by allowing rapid mutational analysis of multiple 
genes in human cancer but our results indicate the need for careful sequence
analysis to avoid false positive results.

As next-generation sequencing increases access to human genetic variation, the
challenge of determining clinical significance of variants becomes ever more
acute. Germline variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can confer substantial
lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Assessment of variant pathogenicity
is a vital part of clinical genetic testing for these genes. A database of
clinical observations of BRCA variants is a critical resource in that process.
This article describes BRCA Share, a database created by a unique international 
alliance of academic centers and commercial testing laboratories. By integrating 
the content of the Universal Mutation Database generated by the French Unicancer 
Genetic Group with the testing results of two large commercial laboratories,
Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp), BRCA Share
has assembled one of the largest publicly accessible collections of BRCA variants
currently available. Although access is available to academic researchers without
charge, commercial participants in the project are required to pay a support fee 
and contribute their data. The fees fund the ongoing curation effort, as well as 
planned experiments to functionally characterize variants of uncertain
significance. BRCA Share databases can therefore be considered as models of
successful data sharing between private companies and the academic world.

Hormone therapy after prophylactic risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 
in women who have BRCA gene mutation.

Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation have substantially higher risk for
developing not only breast and ovarian cancers, but also for primary peritoneal, 
Fallopian tube, colonic, pancreatic cancers, uterine papillary serous
adenocarcinoma and malignant melanoma. The risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 39
to 49% by 70 years of age in BRCA1 mutation carriers and from 11 to 18% for those
with a BRCA2 mutation, whilst breast cancer increases similarly within women who 
have either the BRCA1 mutation or the BRCA2 mutation, from about 20% in women in 
their forties, 37% by the age of 50 years, 55% by 60 years and more than 70% by
the age of 70 years. Prophylactic risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
(RRBSO) provides significantly greater benefits with the view of reducing the
risk for gynecological and breast cancer (decreasing ovarian cancer risk by
85-95%, breast cancer risk by about 53-68% and removes occult or undetected
cancers in 2-18% of such women) compared to other conservative options, namely
screening/surveillance or use of chemopreventative agents. RRBSO will result in
significant menopausal symptoms, increased risk for bone mineral loss, increasing
risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis, and cognitive dysfunction. Risk for
cardiovascular disease is also increased if the procedure is performed in women
less than 50 years of age. This article analyzes the role of RRBSO in women with 
BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations with no personal history of breast cancer and the impact of
hormone therapy on risk for breast and gynecological cancers if used after the
procedure to alleviate the resulting menopausal symptoms.

Clinical mutation screening of the cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2
generates many unclassified variants (UVs). Most of these UVs are either rare
missense substitutions or nucleotide substitutions near the splice junctions of
the protein coding exons. Previously, we developed a quantitative method for
evaluation of BRCA gene UVs-the "integrated evaluation"-that combines a sequence 
analysis-based prior probability of pathogenicity with patient and/or tumor
observational data to arrive at a posterior probability of pathogenicity. One
limitation of the sequence analysis-based prior has been that it evaluates UVs
from the perspective of missense substitution severity but not probability to
disrupt normal mRNA splicing. Here, we calibrated output from the splice-site
fitness program MaxEntScan to generate spliceogenicity-based prior probabilities 
of pathogenicity for BRCA gene variants; these range from 0.97 for variants with 
high probability to damage a donor or acceptor to 0.02 for exonic variants that
do not impact a splice junction and are unlikely to create a de novo donor. We
created a database http://priors.hci.utah.edu/PRIORS/ that provides the combined 
missense substitution severity and spliceogenicity-based probability of
pathogenicity for BRCA gene single-nucleotide substitutions. We also updated the 
BRCA gene Ex-UV LOVD, available at http://hci-exlovd.hci.utah.edu, with 77
re-evaluable variants.

DNA stabilization by the upregulation of estrogen signaling in BRCA gene mutation
carriers.

Suba Z(1).

Author information: 
(1)Surgical and Molecular Tumor Pathology Centre, National Institute of Oncology,
Budapest, Hungary.

Currently available scientific evidence erroneously suggests that mutagenic
weakness or loss of the BRCA1/2 genes may liberate the proliferative effects of
estrogen signaling, which provokes DNA damage and genomic instability.
Conversely, BRCA mutation seems to be an imbalanced defect, crudely inhibiting
the upregulation of estrogen receptor expression and liganded transcriptional
activity, whereas estrogen receptor-repressor functions become predominant. In
BRCA-proficient cases, estrogen signaling orchestrates the activity of cell
proliferation and differentiation with high safety, while upregulating the
expression and DNA-stabilizing impact of BRCA genes. In turn, BRCA proteins
promote estrogen signaling by proper estrogen synthesis via CYP19 gene regulation
and by induction of the appropriate expression and transcriptional activity of
estrogen receptors. In this exquisitely organized regulatory system, the
dysfunction of each player may jeopardize genome stability and lead to severe
chronic diseases, such as cancer development. Female organs, such as breast,
endometrium, and ovary, exhibiting regular cyclic proliferative activity are
particularly vulnerable in case of disturbances in either estrogen signaling or
BRCA-mediated DNA repair. BRCA mutation carrier women may apparently be healthy
or exhibit clinical signs of deficient estrogen signaling in spite of
hyperestrogenism. Even women who enjoy sufficient compensatory DNA-defending
activities are at risk of tumor development because many endogenous and
environmental factors may jeopardize the mechanisms of extreme compensatory
processes. Natural estrogens have numerous benefits in tumor prevention and
therapy even in BRCA mutation carriers. There are no toxic effects even in
sky-high doses and all physiologic cellular functions are strongly upregulated,
while malignant tumor cells are recognized and killed in a Janus-faced manner.

Familial breast cancer accounts for 5-10% of all breast cancers. Due to BRCA1/2
tumour suppressor gene mutation, hereditary breast and ovarian syndrome is the
most common form. Risk-reducing gynaecological and breast surgery is offered to
such patients in ever-increasing numbers. Hence, the development of a
multi-specialty combined treatment approach is called for. Twenty-two BRCA
gene-mutation carrier women underwent one-stage gynaecological and breast
risk-reducing surgery and immediate reconstruction between January 2005 and
December 2011 at the Belfast City Hospital. Their mean age was 41.2 years (median
41 years). Nearly half of the patients were BRCA2 and a quarter were BRCA1
carriers. The rest were positive for both genes. Hormone-replacement therapy was 
initiated in 14 women. Average theatre time and stay in the hospital were three
hours and two and a half days, respectively. Two patients developed complications
unrelated to combining the procedures. Both were treated conservatively and
recovered. The one-stage approach logically proves economical by limiting the
time the patients are in the hospital and away from work. We describe our
multidisciplinary team service that is offering safe and economical one-stage
risk-reducing surgery and reconstruction to young BRCA gene-mutation carrier
women in Northern Ireland.

individuals from 289 families with a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Excluding
Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations, we observed 9 deleterious BRCA mutations five
or more times in ostensibly unrelated families and another 13 mutations in 3-4
families. We hypothesized that some of the rarer recurrent mutations observed in 
our population were due to different branches of the same family being tested
independently without knowledge of previous testing of relatives. We examined 90 
pedigrees for individuals with the same mutations that were seen three or more
times for shared reported family medical history or surnames. Familial links were
made in four instances out of a total of 22 shared mutations despite the fact
that individuals were not aware that another family member had been tested. As
more individuals undergo BRCA testing, we propose that this phenomenon will
become more common. Being unaware of previous testing in a family not only
affects the risk assessment but also likely increases the costs associated with
the genetic testing and subsequent cancer screening in many cases.

Requirement of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C for BRCA gene expression
and homologous recombination.

America.

BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 (hnRNP C) is a core
component of 40S ribonucleoprotein particles that bind pre-mRNAs and influence
their processing, stability and export. Breast cancer tumor suppressors BRCA1,
BRCA2 and PALB2 form a complex and play key roles in homologous recombination
(HR), DNA double strand break (DSB) repair and cell cycle regulation following
DNA damage.
METHODS: PALB2 nucleoprotein complexes were isolated using tandem affinity
purification from nuclease-solubilized nuclear fraction. Immunofluorescence was
used for localization studies of proteins. siRNA-mediated gene silencing and flow
cytometry were used for studying DNA repair efficiency and cell cycle
distribution/checkpoints. The effect of hnRNP C on mRNA abundance was assayed
using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR.
RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: We identified hnRNP C as a component of a nucleoprotein
complex containing breast cancer suppressor proteins PALB2, BRCA2 and BRCA1.
Notably, other components of the 40S ribonucleoprotein particle were not present 
in the complex. hnRNP C was found to undergo significant changes of sub-nuclear
localization after ionizing radiation (IR) and to partially localize to DNA
damage sites. Depletion of hnRNP C substantially altered the normal balance of
repair mechanisms following DSB induction, reducing HR usage in particular, and
impaired S phase progression after IR. Moreover, loss of hnRNP C strongly reduced
the abundance of key HR proteins BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and BRIP1, which can be
attributed, at least in part, to the downregulation of their mRNAs due to
aberrant splicing. Our results establish hnRNP C as a key regulator of BRCA gene 
expression and HR-based DNA repair. They also suggest the existence of an RNA
regulatory program at sites of DNA damage, which involves a unique function of
hnRNP C that is independent of the 40S ribonucleoprotein particles and most other
hnRNP proteins.

Factors affecting the decision to undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy
among women with BRCA gene mutation.

The objective of this study was to identify factors that affect the decision to
undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations
carriers in South Korea. The medical records of 124 women who had been found to
have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation at our institution between May 2003 and
December 2011 were reviewed. The carriers were divided into RRSO and non-RRSO
groups for comparison of their clinicopathologic, socio-economic, and
psychosocial factors. Of the 71 carriers eligible for RRSO, 21 had undergone
RRSO. In univariate analysis, classification of carriers into 3 groups by decade 
of life (4th, 5th, or 6th and later decade) and subsequent analysis revealed that
52.6% of carriers in the 5th decade had undergone RRSO, a rate significantly
higher than that of the other age groups (p = 0.007). The RRSO rate was higher in
carriers with a personal history of breast cancer than in those without (39.2%
vs. 5.0%, p = 0.004), in carriers with a family history of breast cancer than in 
those without (35.5% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.065), and in carriers with a family history
of ovarian cancer than in those carriers without a family history (66.7% vs.
24.2%, p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis identified age and personal history of
breast cancer as independent factors affecting the decision to undergo RRSO. Age 
and personal history of breast cancer are important factors in the decision to
undergo, and should thus be considered when counseling BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

An association of preferential X chromosome inactivation (XCI) with BRCA gene
status and breast/ovarian cancer risk has been reported. We evaluated XCI in a
large group of BRCA mutation carriers compared to non-carriers and investigated
associations between preferential XCI (<U+2A7E>90:10) and age, mutated gene, cancer
development and chemotherapy. XCI was analysed by human androgen receptor
(HUMARA) assay and pyrosequencing in 437 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers and 445
age-matched controls. The distribution of XCI patterns in the two groups was
compared by logistic regression analysis. The association between preferential
XCI and selected variables was investigated in both univariate and multivariate
fashion. In univariate analyses preferential XCI was not significantly associated
with the probability of being a BRCA mutation carrier, nor with cancer status,
whereas chemotherapeutic regime and age both showed a significant association. In
multivariate analysis only age maintained significance (odds ratio, 1.056; 95%
confidence interval, 1.016-1.096). Our findings do not support the usefulness of 
XCI analysis for the identification of BRCA mutation carriers and cancer risk
assessment. The increasing preferential XCI frequency with ageing and the
association with chemotherapy justify extending the investigation to other
categories of female cancer patients to identify possible X-linked loci
implicated in cell survival.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the population of women in southwestern Ontario who were
diagnosed with potentially preventable BRCA mutation-related breast cancer.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: The Cancer Genetics Clinic of the London Regional Cancer Program in
London, Ont.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients younger than 52 years of age who were referred to the
London Regional Cancer Program Cancer Genetics Clinic between 1997 and 2007 for
BRCA testing after being diagnosed with breast cancer (N = 1017).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations
and the proportion of women who would have qualified, based on family cancer
history, for referral for genetic counseling and testing before their breast
cancer diagnoses.
RESULTS: Among the 1017 women referred for BRCA testing, 63 women younger than 52
years of age who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were found, subsequent to 
this diagnosis, to have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. Of these, 41 (65%) had
family cancer histories that would have qualified them for genetic counseling and
testing, according to provincial criteria, before their own breast cancer
diagnoses. Of the 63 women, most (81%) had been referred for BRCA gene mutation
testing by their oncologists or surgeons.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the diagnosis of breast cancer could have
been anticipated, and perhaps in some cases prevented, in up to two-thirds of
high-risk women younger than 52 years of age in southwestern Ontario. If the
high-risk status of these women had been recognized, they might have had the
opportunity to choose genetic counseling, testing, more effective cancer
surveillance, and potentially preventive options. The results of this study call 
for increased public and care provider awareness about hereditary breast cancer
risk to promote women's ability to choose to access genetic counseling.

susana.banerjee@rmh.nhs.uk

Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are showing considerable promise for
the treatment of BRCA mutation-associated ovarian and breast cancer. This
approach exploits a synthetic lethal strategy to target the specific DNA repair
pathway in cancers that harbor mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
Accumulating evidence suggests that PARP inhibitors may have a wider application 
in the treatment of sporadic, high-grade serous ovarian cancers and other cancers
including endometrial cancer. In this review, we discuss the clinical development
of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer and explore challenges that need to be
addressed if the full potential of these agents is to be realized.

The variable penetrance of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes suggests that other genetic 
or environmental factors may interact with these mutations to modify breast
cancer risk. The objective of this study was to measure departures from
multiplicative effects of alcohol consumption and BRCA gene mutations. A cohort
of French-Canadian breast cancer patients was tested for BRCA gene mutations and 
completed a food frequency questionnaire. The case-only odds ratio (COR) was
calculated. A total of 857 women, including 10 BRCA1 and 33 BRCA2 mutation
carriers, participated in the study. No significant interaction between alcohol
consumption and BRCA1 mutations was detected, although the interaction with wine 
consumption suggested a sub-multiplicative effect (COR = 0.38, 95% CI:
0.08-1.81). Consumption of alcohol other than wine interacted significantly with 
BRCA2 mutations (COR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.03-4.49). Consumption of wine may protect 
against BRCA1-associated tumors, while women with BRCA2 mutations may be at
greater risk of alcohol-induced breast cancer.

To investigate the mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and determine whether
clinic-pathological factors related to BRCA gene mutation. Mastectomy specimens
from 360 breast cancers were enrolled and examined in the study. The relationship
between BRCA gene mutation and clinic-pathological factors was evaluated.
Overall, 280 patients were BRCA negative and 80 got BRCA gene mutation.
Triple-negative breast cancers--i.e., breast cancers that do not express estrogen
receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR) or human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2/neu)--was observed in 53.85% of the BRCA1 mutation patients, in 
28.57% of the BRCA2 mutation cases, while 14.29% of BRCA negative patients. BRCA1
mutation patients got a heavy lymph node metastasis and higher nuclear grade
tumors than the others (P = 0.004, 0.007). Furthermore, BRCA mutation was also
found to be significantly related to ER, PR and HER2/neu status (P < 0.05). BRCA1
expression was not associated with breast cancer-specific survival in the
triple-negative breast cancers (P = 0.742). After Cox regression, BRCA1 mutation 
was not shown to be an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer. These
findings substantiated the possibility of tumors associated with BRCA1 mutations 
divided into two distinct groups, triple-negative and non-triple-negative groups 
requires further investigation.

BRCA gene structure and function in tumor suppression: a repair-centric
perspective.

York City, NY 10065, USA.

Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are characterized by deficient
repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. Defective DNA
double-strand break repair has been not only implicated as a key contributor to
tumorigenesis in mutation carriers but also represents a potential target for
therapy. The transcriptional similarities between BRCA1-deficient tumors and
sporadic tumors of the basal-like subtype have led to the investigation of
homologous recombination repair-directed therapy in triple-negative tumors, which
demonstrates overlap with the basal-like subtype. We broaden the scope of this
topic by addressing a "repair-defective" rather than "BRCA1-like" phenotype. We
discuss structural and functional aspects of key repair proteins including BRCA1,
BRCA2, BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1, and partner and localizer
of BRCA2 and describe the phenotypic consequences of their loss at the cellular, 
tissue, and organism level. We review potential mechanisms of repair pathway
dysfunction in sporadic tumors and address how the identification of such defects
may guide the application of repair-directed therapies.

We performed presymptomatic carrier detection by BRCA gene testing of the family 
members of three familial breast cancer kindred diagnosed with pathogenetic
mutation in BRCA genes. All members were over 20 years of age. We explained
familial breast cancer and BRCA gene testing, and obtained autonomic consent
before gene testing. Genetic testing revealed twins in a family were dizygotic.
In another family bilateral breast cancer occurred in a carrier after five years 
of genetic testing. Carriers are at high risk of breast cancer and have to
receive breast cancer screening and familial tumor counseling. Non-carriers are
at the same risk of breast cancer as the general population.

Discovery of mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes
BRCA1 and BRCA2 can have emotional consequences for both the tested individual
and his or her relatives. This secondary analysis study investigated how BRCA
testing impacts family dynamics and relationships. For the original study, a
grounded theory inquiry, participants were recruited from a hereditary
breast/ovarian cancer syndrome support website and open-ended interviews were
performed asking about individual and family experiences after BRCA testing. All 
12 participants whose interviews were included in the secondary analysis had a
BRCA mutation. For the secondary analysis, thematic analysis was conducted and
revealed three main themes characterizing the effect of BRCA testing on family
relationships: 1. That the first in the family to have testing or seek genetic
counseling takes on a special family role that can be difficult for them; 2. That
discussions in the family often change; and 3. That individuals may feel more or 
less connected to certain family members. These changes seemed to relate to
family cancer history, relationships, coping strategies, communication patterns, 
and mutation status. Genetic counselors might find it useful to explore these
issues in order to prepare clients before BRCA testing and to support them
through shifts in family dynamics after disclosure of results.

OR 97403, USA.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high
cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including
microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb. Here we present cDNA 
sequences, genetic mapping, and genomic analyses for the four previously
undescribed zebrafish FA genes (fanci, fancj, fancm, and fancn), and show that
they reverted to single copy after the teleost genome duplication. We tested the 
hypothesis that FA genes are expressed during embryonic development in tissues
that are disrupted in human patients by investigating fanc gene expression
patterns. We found fanc gene maternal message, which can provide Fanc proteins to
repair DNA damage encountered in rapid cleavage divisions. Zygotic expression was
broad but especially strong in eyes, central nervous system and hematopoietic
tissues. In the pectoral fin bud at hatching, fanc genes were expressed
specifically in the apical ectodermal ridge, a signaling center for fin/limb
development that may be relevant to the radius/thumb anomaly of FA patients.
Hatching embryos expressed fanc genes strongly in the oral epithelium, a site of 
squamous cell carcinomas in FA patients. Larval and adult zebrafish expressed
fanc genes in proliferative regions of the brain, which may be related to
microcephaly in FA. Mature ovaries and testes expressed fanc genes in specific
stages of oocyte and spermatocyte development, which may be related to DNA repair
during homologous recombination in meiosis and to infertility in human patients. 
The intestine strongly expressed some fanc genes specifically in proliferative
zones. Our results show that zebrafish has a complete complement of fanc genes in
single copy and that these genes are expressed in zebrafish embryos and adults in
proliferative tissues that are often affected in FA patients. These results
support the notion that zebrafish offers an attractive experimental system to
help unravel mechanisms relevant not only to FA, but also to breast cancer, given
the involvement of fancj (brip1), fancn (palb2) and fancd1 (brca2) in both
conditions.

Empirical and clinical literature suggests a temporal thread running through
family narratives of hereditary disease, linking past experiences to current
beliefs about risk. This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing
hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer
and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family
development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration
completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts
were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key
themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct
priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have
children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to
have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at
finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer
world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further,
participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve
desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer
diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery. Clinical practice and research
implications are discussed.

Ethical issues related to BRCA gene testing in orthodox Jewish women.

Mor P(1), Oberle K.

Author information: 
(1)University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. pmor@012.net.il

Persons exhibiting mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, have
a greatly increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. The
incidence of BRCA gene mutation is very high in Ashkenazi Jewish women of
European descent, and many issues can arise, particularly for observant Orthodox 
women, because of their genetic status. Their obligations under the Jewish code
of ethics, referred to as Jewish law, with respect to the acceptability of
various risk-reducing strategies, may be poorly understood. In this article the
moral direction that Jewish law gives to women regarding testing,
confidentiality, and other issues is explored. The intent is to broaden nurses'
knowledge of how a particular religious tradition could impact on decision making
around genetics testing, with the aim of enhancing their understanding of
culturally sensitive ethical care.

CONTEXT: An autosomal dominant pattern of hereditary breast cancer may be masked 
by small family size or transmission through males given sex-limited expression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if BRCA gene mutations are more prevalent among single
cases of early onset breast cancer in families with limited vs adequate family
structure than would be predicted by currently available probability models.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1543 women seen at US high-risk
clinics for genetic cancer risk assessment and BRCA gene testing were enrolled in
a prospective registry study between April 1997 and February 2007. Three hundred 
six of these women had breast cancer before age 50 years and no first- or
second-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was whether family structure,
assessed from multigenerational pedigrees, predicts BRCA gene mutation status.
Limited family structure was defined as fewer than 2 first- or second-degree
female relatives surviving beyond age 45 years in either lineage. Family
structure effect and mutation probability by the Couch, Myriad, and BRCAPRO
models were assessed with stepwise multiple logistic regression. Model
sensitivity and specificity were determined and receiver operating characteristic
curves were generated.
RESULTS: Family structure was limited in 153 cases (50%). BRCA gene mutations
were detected in 13.7% of participants with limited vs 5.2% with adequate family 
structure. Family structure was a significant predictor of mutation status (odds 
ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-6.73; P = .02). Although none of the
models performed well, receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that 
modification of BRCAPRO output by a corrective probability index accounting for
family structure was the most accurate BRCA gene mutation status predictor (area 
under the curve, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.81; P<.001) for single
cases of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Family structure can affect the accuracy of mutation probability
models. Genetic testing guidelines may need to be more inclusive for single cases
of breast cancer when the family structure is limited and probability models need
to be recreated using limited family history as an actual variable.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the sonographic features of
breast cancer gene BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast carcinomas in comparison
with "sporadic" breast carcinomas and benign breast masses.
METHODS: Sonograms of 233 breast masses, including 33 BRCA-associated malignant
masses (BRCA1, 15; BRCA2, 18), 148 sporadic malignant masses, and 52 benign
masses, were reviewed by consensus by 2 radiologists according to American
College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terminology.
RESULTS: Most of the sporadic and BRCA1-and BRCA2-associated cancers displayed an
irregular shape (91.2%, 93.3%, and 83.3%, respectively). BRCA1-associated cancers
showed microlobulated margins in 53.3% versus 33.8% (sporadic) and 33.3% (BRCA2).
A parallel orientation was most frequently encountered in BRCA1-associated
lesions (46.7%) versus sporadic (33.8%) and BRCA2 (33.3%), whereas posterior
acoustic shadowing was least frequently seen in BRCA1-associated lesions (13.3%) 
versus BRCA2 (16.7%) and sporadic (31.1%). Most (73.3%) of the BRCA1-associated
lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 4, whereas most of the sporadic and
BRCA2-associated lesions were classified as BI-RADS category 5 (66.2% and 72.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Sonographic features of BRCA-associated and sporadic breast
carcinomas do not differ substantially. BRCA1-associated breast carcinomas trend 
toward less malignant sonographic characteristics, but strict application of the 
BI-RADS categorizations demands that they be classified as category 4 or 5.

Road, London, UK. u.menon@ucl.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: In May 2006, the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority
(HFEA) approved use of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for lower
penetrance, late onset cancer susceptibility syndromes such as hereditary breast 
and ovarian cancer (HBOC). This is the first report on views of BRCA gene
mutation carriers on use of PGD for HBOC.
METHODS: Between December 2005 and February 2006, a postal survey of BRCA
mutation carriers attending a Familial Cancer Clinic was undertaken.
RESULTS: Of 102 women sent questionnaires, 52 (51%) responded. Thirty-nine (75%) 
felt it was acceptable to offer PGD for HBOC. Fifteen (37.5%) of 40 who had
completed their families would personally have considered PGD if it had been
available. Only one of seven (14%) contemplating a future pregnancy would
consider PGD. Eighteen (35%) wrote extensively about their concerns including
increasing availability of effective treatment and good quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of BRCA gene mutation carriers are supportive of
offering PGD to others, thus endorsing the HFEA decision. However, most women
would not consider it personally. Concerns raised highlight the need for regular 
HFEA reviews of the licensing criteria, as HBOC may cease to be a "serious life
threatening illness" in the future.

The translation of genetic knowledge from the research laboratory into the
clinical arena is a complex and challenging process. The skills and expertise
required are different from those required by a successful laboratory scientist. 
Recognising the scale of the challenge, University College London has established
the Institute of Human Genetics and Health; a unique, multi-disciplinary
initiative examining the impact of genetic knowledge on human health and disease.
The testing of the BRCA1 and 2 genes in the North East Thames region is an
interesting example of the translation of genetic testing into clinical care, and
the corresponding complexities relating to informed consent that can arise. The
development of a remote cancer genetics service within North East Thames Regional
Genetics Service, which uses live, real time teleconferencing technology, is a
powerful example of the fact that the National Health Service (NHS) can adapt,
and integrate new technology into its working practice.

INTRODUCTION: Female germline BRCA gene mutation carriers are at increased risk
for developing breast cancer. The purpose of our study was to establish whether
healthy BRCA mutation carriers demonstrate an increased frequency of aberrant
gene promoter hypermethylation in ductal lavage (DL) fluid, compared with
predictive genetic test negative controls, that might serve as a surrogate marker
of BRCA1/2 mutation status and/or breast cancer risk.
METHODS: The pattern of CpG island hypermethylation within the promoter region of
a panel of four genes (RAR-beta, HIN-1, Twist and Cyclin D2) was assessed by
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction using free DNA extracted from DL
fluid.
RESULTS: Fifty-one DL samples from 24 healthy women of known BRCA mutation status
(7 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 12 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 5 controls) were
available for methylation analysis. Eight of 19 (42.1%) BRCA mutation carriers
were found to have at least one hypermethylated gene in the four-gene panel. Two 
BRCA mutation carriers, in whom aberrant methylation was found, also had duct
epithelial cell atypia identified. No hypermethylation was found in DL samples
from 5 negative controls (p = 0.13).
CONCLUSION: We found substantial levels of aberrant methylation, with the use of 
a four-gene panel, in the fluid from the breasts of healthy BRCA mutation
carriers compared with controls. Methylation analysis of free DNA in DL fluid may
offer a useful surrogate marker for BRCA1/2 mutation status and/or breast cancer 
risk. Further studies are required for the evaluation of the specificity and
predictive value of aberrant methylation in DL fluid for future breast cancer
development in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

AIM: This study aimed to analyze whether the occurrence of both breast and
ovarian cancer in a woman serves as a marker for BRCA gene mutations.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This population-based study included 256 women in western
Sweden who developed both invasive breast and ovarian tumors between 1958 and
1999. Archival paraffin tissue blocks of their tumors were retrieved for
DNA-extraction to analyze the founder mutation, BRCA1 c.3171_3175dup
(c.3171ins5), which is most common in this geographic area and four other common 
Scandinavian BRCA1 gene mutations and one BRCA2 mutation. Together, account these
mutations for approximately 75% of the BRCA1/2 gene mutations in the clinical
unit.
RESULTS: Ninteen percent (95% confidence interval (CI) 14-24%) of the women
carried one of the analyzed BRCA1 gene mutations but none of the women were
positive for the analyzed BRCA2 mutation. One-third of the women with both tumors
before age 60 were mutation carriers. BRCA1 c.3171_3175dup (c.3171ins5)
constituted 84% of all identified mutations. Although the majority of breast
cancers were invasive ductal and atypical medullary types, a variety of other
breast malignancies were seen among mutation carriers. Serous ovarian carcinomas 
predominated among ovarian tumors. A variety of other ovarian tumors, including
three granulosa-theca cell tumors, were also observed among mutation carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of both breast and ovarian cancer in a woman is
associated with a high likelihood of a constitutional BRCA1 mutation. These women
and their families might therefore be considered for mutation screening after
appropriate genetic counselling.

Female BRCA gene mutation carriers are at increased risk for developing breast
cancer. Ductal lavage is a novel method for sampling breast ductal fluid,
providing epithelial cells for cytologic assessment and a source of free DNA for 
molecular analyses. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the BRCA loci in ductal
lavage fluid is a potential biomarker of breast cancer risk. The LOH rate was
measured at the BRCA1/2 loci and compared with that at a control locus (APC)
using free DNA from the ductal lavage fluid of BRCA carriers and predictive test 
negative controls. We evaluated the reproducibility of these analyses. Free DNA
sufficient for PCR amplification was obtained from 33 ductal lavage samples of 17
healthy women of known BRCA status (14 BRCA carriers and 3 controls). LOH rates
of 36.4% to 56.3% at the BRCA1 locus and 45% to 61.5% at the BRCA2 locus were
found among BRCA carriers. The LOH rate at the APC locus was lower (18.5%). The
interaliquot reproducibility for the D17S855 marker of the BRCA1 locus was 66.7%.
Intraaliquot reproducibility was 90%. Although we successfully isolated
sufficient free DNA from ductal lavage fluid for PCR amplification, the degree of
reproducibility of these LOH studies raises questions about the robustness of
this technique as a risk assessment tool in the evaluation of high-risk women.
Further studies are required to evaluate the specificity and predictive value of 
LOH in ductal lavage fluid for breast cancer development.

The European opposition against the BRCA gene patents.

In 2001, the European Patent Organisation (EPO) granted 3 patents on the BRCA1
gene (EP-B-699754, EP-B-705903, EP-B-705902) to Myriad Genetics. The patents, and
the option of the patent holder to strictly exert its monopoly right by
requesting that all diagnostic testing be done at its laboratory in the United
States, has evoked strong reactions in Europe. Several opposition procedures have
been started against these patents. After oral hearings at the EPO in Munich in
May 2004, the first patent was revoked due to errors contained in the initially
filed sequence. At oral proceedings in January 2005, the other two patents were
severely limited in scope. The discussion on inventive step on the cloning of the
BRCA1 gene - other than the one that relates to the priority date - has not taken
place. In other words, the EPO has not questioned the patentability of this gene 
per se. The author participated in the hearings in Munich and would like to give 
the genetic community a firsthand account of the case.

Tumor suppressor genes that perform apparently generic cellular functions
nonetheless cause tissue-specific syndromes in the human population when they are
mutated in the germline. The two major hereditary breast/ovarian cancer
predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, appear to participate in a common pathway 
that is involved in the control of homologous recombination and in the
maintenance of genomic integrity. How might such functions translate into the
specific suppression of cancers of the breast and ovarian epithelia? Recent
advances in the study of BRCA1 and BRCA2, discussed herein, have provided new
opportunities to address this question.

Breast conservation therapy for invasive breast cancer in Ashkenazi women with
BRCA gene founder mutations.

BACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with
an increased risk of breast cancer. Whether women with breast cancer who have
inherited mutations in these genes have a different outcome after breast
conservation therapy than women with "sporadic" cancer is unresolved.
Consequently, we compared the outcomes after breast conservation therapy in
Ashkenazi women with or without germline mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2
(hereafter called BRCA).
METHODS: We studied 305 women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent undergoing
breast-conserving treatment for 329 invasive breast cancers. We reviewed their
clinical records, retrieved their archival tissue samples, and tested those
samples for the founder mutations BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC, and BRCA2
6174delT. Genetic results were linked to clinical data and outcomes by univariate
and multivariate analyses. All Pvalues are two-sided.
RESULTS: We detected mutations in BRCA genes in 28 of 305 women. Women with BRCA 
mutations were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 50 years
(P<.001) and to have lymph node involvement (P =.04). Ipsilateral breast tumor
recurrence was more common in women with BRCA mutations, although this did not
reach statistical significance (relative risk [RR] = 1.79; 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 0.64-5.03). Women with mutations were more likely to develop
contralateral breast cancer (RR = 3.50; 95% CI = 1.78-8.74; P =.001). Distant
disease-free survival was shorter in women with mutations (66.2% versus 84.3% at 
10 years; P =.05), as was breast cancer-specific survival (71.9% versus 87.2% at 
10 years; P =.02). Tumor stage and nodal status, but not mutation status, were
predictive of distant disease-free and breast cancer-specific survival in
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with BRCA founder mutations are at increased risk for breast
cancer-related events after breast conservation. However, mutation status is not 
an independent predictor of survival and should not influence decisions regarding
adjuvant therapy. The increased contralateral breast cancer risk in women
heterozygous for BRCA mutations mandates careful surveillance.

Comment in
    Ann Surg Oncol. 1998 Oct-Nov;5(7):567-8.

BACKGROUND: The availability of a commercial test for the breast cancer
susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, has generated interest in both the medical
community and the general public.
METHODS: Patients and family members were approached in the waiting room and
asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire about their awareness of breast
cancer genes and breast cancer gene testing, and their desire to be tested. chi2 
analysis was used to analyze frequencies between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 354 women completed a questionnaire concerning the breast
cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. The very young, the very old, and African-Americans
were the least informed in terms of awareness of the genes and the availability
of testing for the breast cancer susceptibility genes. Jewish people, people with
a college education or beyond, people earning more than $30,000 a year, and
Caucasians were more aware of the genes and of testing for these genes. Interest 
in being tested was similar in all groups, except for participants over 60 and
those who had only an elementary-school education.
CONCLUSIONS: Information concerning the breast cancer susceptibility genes has
not reached the general public uniformly. A concerted effort is needed if this
information is to be passed on to those people at risk.
