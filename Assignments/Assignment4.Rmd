[Data frame](Data/mean_num.csv)


```Create a tibble that includes the complete observations for the top 10 most frequently observed species. First generate a top 10 list and then use this list to filter all observations. Export this tibble as a .csv file saved to a folder called “Results” folder within your R project and add link to the markdown document.```
