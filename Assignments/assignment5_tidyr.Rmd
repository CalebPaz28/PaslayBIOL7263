```Pivot and merge these two data sets into a single tidy tibble. Export this tibble as a .csv file saved to a folder called “Results” folder within your R project.```

```With this tidy tibble, generate a new tibble of the mean +/- standard deviation of the residual mass (mass/body length) by treatment and sex. Export this tibble as a .csv file saved to a folder called “Results” folder within your R project.```

```In an Rmarkdown document present the code you used to pivot, merge, etc. and the links to the commented R script and final .csv files stored in your Data folder. Knit this to an html file and link on your portfolio page.```
